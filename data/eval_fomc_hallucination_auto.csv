                    July 30â31, 2024

A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.1

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Financial conditions eased modestly over the intermeeting period, reflecting lower long-term interest rates and higher equity prices. The manager noted that current financial conditions appeared to be providing neither a headwind nor tailwind to growth.

Nominal Treasury yields declined over the period, with shorter-term yields having decreased by more than longer-term yields, leading to a steepening of the yield curve. Treasury yields remained sensitive to surprises in economic data, particularly consumer price index releases and employment reports. While near-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period, longer-term forward measures were little changed. Measures of inflation expectations obtained from term structure models were modestly lower. The policy rate path derived from futures prices and the modal path derived from options prices both declined over the intermeeting period and had come into closer alignment with the median of the modal responses from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants. Policy expectations, however measured, pointed to a first rate cut at the September FOMC meeting, at least one more cut later in the year, and further policy easing next year.

In the equity markets, the high perceived likelihood of a September cut in the target range for the policy rate induced a notable appreciation in the stocks of firms with small and medium capitalization, which tend to be more sensitive to interest rates. Stocks of larger companies, especially those in the technology sector, underperformed. Second-quarter earnings reports received before the meeting had been slightly above analysts' expectations, although some companies noted a softening in consumer spending.

Expectations for policy rates in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) declined, as recent data generally pointed to continued progress on inflation. Although most AFE central banks had cut their policy rates or were expected to do so soon, the manager noted that market participants continued to expect the Bank of Japan to tighten policy this year. The sudden announcement of a French election contributed to some short-term market volatility early in the intermeeting period, including a widening between yields of French and German 10-year sovereign bonds and a widening in spreads for off-the-run U.S. Treasury securities, but the effects on U.S. Treasury markets were short lived.

The effective federal funds rate remained unchanged over the intermeeting period, but the manager noted that rates on repurchase agreements (repo) had edged higher, reflecting increased demand for financing Treasury securities as well as the expected effects of gradual balance sheet normalization. Use of the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The staff projected that ON RRP usage would decline more noticeably over the remainder of the year, particularly as issuance of Treasury bills increases. However, the manager noted that it was possible that idiosyncratic factors specific to some ON RRP participants might support ON RRP balances in the months ahead. Looking at a range of money market indicators, the manager concluded that reserves remained abundant but indicated that the staff would continue to closely monitor developments in money markets. Finally, the manager described a set of technical adjustments to the production of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had proposed in a recent public consultation.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that U.S. economic activity had advanced solidly so far this year, but at a markedly slower pace than in the second half of 2023. Labor market conditions continued to ease: Job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate moved up further but remained low. Consumer price inflation was well below its year-earlier pace but remained somewhat elevated.

Consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âwas about the same in June as it was at the start of the year, though the month-over-month changes in May and June were smaller than those seen earlier in the year. Total PCE price inflation was 2.5 percent in June, and core PCE price inflationâwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food pricesâwas 2.6 percent.

Recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further. Average monthly nonfarm payroll gains in the second quarter were smaller than the average pace seen in the first quarter and over the previous year. The unemployment rate moved up further in June to 4.1 percent; the labor force participation rate ticked up as well, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The unemployment rate for African Americans rose in June, while the rate for Hispanics declined slightly; both rates were above that for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment remained at 1.2 in June, about the same as its pre-pandemic level. Measures of nominal wages continued to decelerate: Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in June, down 0.8 percentage point relative to a year earlier, and the 12-month change in the employment cost index of hourly compensation of private industry workers was 3.9 percent in June, down 0.6 percentage point from its year-earlier pace.

According to the advance release, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose solidly in the second quarter after a modest gain in the first quarter. Over the first half of the year, GDP growth was noticeably slower than its average pace in 2023. However, real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)âwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumâposted a solid second-quarter increase that was in line with its first-quarter pace and only moderately slower than its average rate of increase in 2023.

As in the first quarter, net exports subtracted from U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter. Growth in real exports of goods and services remained tepid overall, as gains in exports of capital goods and consumer goods were partly offset by declines in exports of foods and industrial supplies. By contrast, real imports continued to rise at a brisk pace, driven by further increases in imports of capital goods.

Foreign economic growth was estimated to have been subdued in the second quarter, held down by a sharp deceleration in economic activity in China amid ongoing property-sector woes. In Europe and Latin America, output likely expanded below its trend pace, as restrictive monetary policy continued to be a drag on activity.

Recent global inflation developments were mixed. In the AFEs, headline inflation edged down in the second quarter but generally remained above target levels. In emerging market economies, headline inflation rose a touch overall, reflecting, in part, run-ups in food prices in some countries. The Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank cut their policy rates further, in part citing easing inflation pressures. The People's Bank of China also lowered some key policy rates amid ongoing property-sector woes and weak consumer sentiment.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
The market-implied path for the federal funds rate moved down over the intermeeting period. Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on a larger policy easing by early 2025 than they did just before the June meeting. Consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy path, nominal Treasury yields moved down, on net, with the most pronounced declines at shorter horizons driven largely by decreases in inflation compensation.

Broad stock price indexes rose slightly on net. Yield spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed and remained at about the lowest decile of their respective historical distributions. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose moderately and was somewhat elevated by historical standards, suggesting that investors perceived some, but not outsized, risks to the economic outlook.

Market-based measures of the expected paths of policy rates and sovereign bond yields in most AFEs fell notably, largely in response to declines in U.S. rates. Following the surprise announcement of parliamentary elections in France, the spread between yields of French and German 10-year sovereign bonds widened to its highest level since 2012 but then partially retraced on the outcome of no clear parliamentary majority. The broad dollar index was little changed over the intermeeting period. On balance, moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed and modest.

Overnight secured rates edged up over the intermeeting period, but conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable, with typical dynamics observed surrounding quarter-end. Average usage of the ON RRP facility declined slightly. Banks' total deposit levels increased modestly, as large time deposits displayed moderate inflows.

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs remained elevated over the intermeeting period despite modest declines in some markets. Rates on 30-year conforming residential mortgages declined, on net, over the intermeeting period but stayed near recent high levels. Interest rates on new credit card offers increased slightly, while rates on new auto loans were little changed. Interest rates on small business loans remained elevated. Yields on an array of fixed-income securitiesâincluding commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, and residential mortgage-backed securitiesâmoved lower to still-elevated levels relative to recent history. The declines were largely driven by decreases in Treasury yields.

Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and large and middle-market private corporations, and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid over the intermeeting period. For smaller firms, however, credit availability remained moderately tight. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported modestly tighter standards and lending terms for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, on net, while reported demand for C&I loans remained about unchanged. Meanwhile, C&I loan balances increased in the second quarter. Regarding commercial real estate (CRE) loans, banks in the July SLOOS reported tightening standards for all loan categories. Nonetheless, bank CRE loan balances increased over the second quarter, albeit at a diminished pace relative to the previous quarter.

Credit remained available for most consumers over the intermeeting period, though credit growth showed signs of moderating. Credit card balances slowed in June, and SLOOS respondents indicated that standards for credit cards tightened moderately in the second quarter. Although banks reported in the SLOOS that lending standards on auto loans were unchanged in the second quarter, growth in auto lending at both banks and nonbanks contracted further. In the residential mortgage market, access to credit was little changed overall and continued to depend on borrowers' credit risk attributes.

Credit quality remained solid for large and midsize firms, home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities but continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated further, with the average delinquency rate for loans in CMBS and the share of nonperforming CRE loans at banks both rising further. Regarding household balance sheets, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre-pandemic lows. Though consumer delinquency rates had increased, particularly among nonprime borrowers, the rise in delinquency rates for both credit cards and auto loans slowed in the second quarter.

The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system's financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained elevated, with estimates of risk premiums across key markets low compared with historical standards. House prices remained elevated relative to fundamentals. CRE prices continued to decline, especially in the multifamily and office sectors, and vacancy rates in these sectors continued to increase.

Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial business leverage was high, but the ability of public firms to service their debt remained solid, in large part due to strong earnings. The fraction of private firms with low debt-servicing ability continued to move up and remained at high levels compared with the past decade. Household balance sheets remained strong overall, as aggregate home equity stayed quite high and delinquencies on mortgage loans remained low.

Leverage in the financial sector was characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high. The fair value of bank assets, however, remained low. For the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds was at its highest recorded level based on data since 2013, partly due to the prevalence of the cashâfutures basis trade. Leverage at life insurers was somewhat elevated, and their holdings of risky and illiquid securities continued to grow.

Funding risks were also characterized as notable. Assets in prime money market funds and other runnable cash-management vehicles remained near historical highs. Life insurers' greater reliance on nontraditional liabilities, coupled with their increasing holdings of risky corporate debt, suggested that adverse shocks to the industry could trigger substantial funding pressures at these firms.

Staff Economic Outlook
The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the July meeting implied a lower rate of resource utilization over the projection period relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting. The staff's outlook for growth in the second half of 2024 had been marked down largely in response to weaker-than-expected labor market indicators. As a result, the output gap at the start of 2025 was somewhat narrower than had been previously projected, although still not fully closed. Over 2025 and 2026, real GDP growth was expected to rise about in line with potential, leaving the output gap roughly flat in those years. The unemployment rate was expected to edge up slightly over the remainder of 2024 and then to remain roughly unchanged in 2025 and 2026.

The staff's inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting, reflecting incoming data and the lower projected level of resource utilization. Both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to decline further as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core inflation were expected to be around 2 percent.

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20 years. Risks to the inflation forecast were still seen as tilted to the upside, albeit to a smaller degree than at the time of the previous meeting. The risks around the forecast for real activity were viewed as skewed to the downside, both because more-persistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the baseline and because the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions might be pointing to a larger-than-anticipated slowdown in aggregate demand growth.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
Participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated and that, in recent months, there had been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. Participants noted that the recent progress on disinflation was broad based across the major subcomponents of core inflation. Core goods prices were about flat from March through June after having risen during the first three months of the year. Price inflation in June for housing services showed a notable slowing, which participants had been anticipating for some time. In addition, core nonhousing services prices had decelerated in recent months. Some participants noted that the recent data corroborated reports from their business contacts that firms' pricing power was waning, as consumers appeared to be more sensitive to price increases. Various contacts had also reported that they had cut prices or were offering discounts to stay competitive, or that declines in input costs had helped reduce pressure on retail prices.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that recent data had increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Almost all participants observed that the factors that had contributed to recent disinflation would likely continue to put downward pressure on inflation in coming months. These factors included a continued waning of pricing power, moderating economic growth, and the runoff in excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic. Many participants noted that the moderation of growth in labor costs as labor market conditions rebalanced would continue to contribute to disinflation, particularly in core nonhousing services prices. Some participants noted that the lags in the time it takes for housing rental conditions for new tenants to show through to aggregate price data for housing services meant that the disinflationary trend in this component would likely continue. Participants also observed that longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored and viewed this anchoring as underpinning the disinflation process. A couple of participants noted that inflation pressures might persist for some time, as they assessed that the economy had considerable momentum, and that, even with some easing of the demand for labor, the labor market remained strong.

Participants assessed that supply and demand conditions in the labor market had continued to come into better balance. The unemployment rate had moved up but remained low, having risen 0.7 percentage point since its trough in April 2023 to 4.1 percent in June. The monthly pace of payroll job gains had moderated from the first quarter but had been solid in recent months. However, many participants noted that reported payroll gains might be overstated, and several assessed that payroll gains may be lower than those needed to keep the unemployment rate constant with a flat labor force participation rate. Participants observed that other indicators also pointed to easing in labor market conditions, including a lower hiring rate and a downtrend in job vacancies since the beginning of the year. Participants noted that the rebalancing of labor market conditions over the past year was also aided by an expansion of the supply of workers, reflecting increases in the labor force participation rate among individuals aged 25 to 54 and a strong pace of immigration. Participants noted that, with continued rebalancing of labor market conditions, nominal wage growth had continued to moderate. Many participants cited reports from District contacts that supported the view that labor market conditions had been easing. In particular, contacts reported that they had been experiencing less difficulty in hiring and retaining workers and that they saw limited wage pressures. Participants generally assessed that, overall, conditions in the labor market had returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemicâstrong but not overheated.

Regarding the outlook for the labor market, participants discussed various indicators of layoffs, including initial claims for unemployment benefits and measures of job separations. Some participants commented that these indicators had remained at levels consistent with a strong labor market. Participants agreed that these and other indicators of labor market conditions merited close monitoring. Several participants said that their District contacts reported that they were actively managing head counts through selective hiring and attrition.

Participants noted that real GDP growth was solid in the first half of the year, though slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year. PDFP growth, which usually gives a better signal than GDP growth of economic momentum, also moderated in the first half, but by less than GDP growth. PDFP expanded at a solid pace, supported by growth in consumer spending and business fixed investment. Participants viewed the moderation in the growth of economic activity to be largely in line with what they had anticipated.

Regarding the household sector, participants observed that consumer spending had slowed from last year's robust pace, consistent with restrictive monetary policy, easing of labor market conditions, and slowing income growth. They noted, however, that consumer spending had still grown at a solid pace in the first half of the year, supported by the still-strong labor market and aggregate household balance sheets. Some participants observed that lower- and moderate-income households were encountering increasing strains as they attempted to meet higher living costs after having largely run down savings accumulated during the pandemic. These participants noted that such strains were evident in indicators such as rising credit card delinquency rates and an increased share of households paying the minimum due on balances, and warranted continued close monitoring. Several participants cited reports that consumers, especially those in lower-income households, were shifting away from discretionary spending and switching to lower-cost food items and brands. A couple of participants remarked that spending by some higher-income households was likely being bolstered by wealth effects from equity and housing price appreciation. Participants noted that residential investment was weak in the second quarter, likely reflecting the pickup in mortgage rates from earlier in the year.

Regarding the business sector, participants noted that conditions varied by firm size, sector, and region. A couple of participants noted that their District contacts had reported larger firms as having a generally stable outlook, while the outlook for smaller firms appeared more uncertain. A few participants said that their contacts reported that conditions in the manufacturing sector were somewhat weaker, while the professional and business services sector and technology-related sectors remained strong. A few participants noted that the agricultural sector continued to face strains stemming from low food commodity prices and high input costs.

Participants discussed the risks and uncertainties around the economic outlook. Upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as having diminished, while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased. Participants saw risks to achieving the inflation and employment objectives as continuing to move into better balance, with a couple noting that they viewed these risks as more or less balanced. Some participants noted that as conditions in the labor market have eased, the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration. As sources of upside risks to inflation, some participants cited the potential for disruptions to supply chains and a further deterioration in geopolitical conditions. A few participants noted that an easing of financial conditions could boost economic activity and present an upside risk to economic growth and inflation.

In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Some participants observed that the banking system was sound but noted risks associated with unrealized losses on securities, reliance on uninsured deposits, and interconnections with nonbank financial intermediaries. In their discussion of bank funding, several participants commented that, because the discount window is an important liquidity backstop, the Federal Reserve should continue to improve the window's operational efficiency and to communicate effectively about the window's value. Participants generally noted that some banks and nonbank financial institutions likely have vulnerabilities associated with high CRE exposures through loan portfolios and holdings of CMBS. Most of these participants remarked that risks related to CRE exposures depend importantly on the property type and the local market conditions of the properties involved. A couple of participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in other markets as well. Many participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and, potentially, the overall economy. Many participants remarked that because a few firms play a substantial role in the provision of information technology services to the financial sector and because of the highly interconnected nature of some firms in the financial industry itself, there was an increased risk that significant cyber disruptions at a small number of key firms could have widespread effects. Several participants noted that leverage in the Treasury market remained a risk, that it would be important to monitor developments regarding Treasury market resilience amid the move to central clearing, or that it is valuable to communicate about the Federal Reserve's standing repo facility as a liquidity backstop. A couple of participants commented on the financial condition of low- and moderate-income households that have exhausted their savings and the importance of monitoring rising delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, job gains had moderated, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. While inflation remained somewhat above the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent, participants noted that inflation had eased over the past year and that recent incoming data indicated some further progress toward the Committee's objective. All participants supported maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, although several observed that the recent progress on inflation and increases in the unemployment rate had provided a plausible case for reducing the target range 25 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision. Participants furthermore judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants noted that growth in economic activity had been solid, there had been some further progress on inflation, and conditions in the labor market had eased. Almost all participants remarked that while the incoming data regarding inflation were encouraging, additional information was needed to provide greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee's 2 percent objective before it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate. Nevertheless, participants viewed the incoming data as enhancing their confidence that inflation was moving toward the Committee's objective. The vast majority observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting. Many participants commented that monetary policy continued to be restrictive, although they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness, and a few participants noted that ongoing disinflation, with no change in the nominal target range for the policy rate, by itself results in a tightening in monetary policy. Most participants remarked on the importance of communicating the Committee's data-dependent approach and emphasized, in particular, that monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path or that those decisions depend on the totality of the incoming data rather than on any particular data point. Several participants stressed the need to monitor conditions in money markets and factors affecting the demand for reserves amid the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants highlighted uncertainties affecting the outlook, such as those regarding the amount of restraint currently provided by monetary policy, the lags with which past and current restraint have affected and will affect economic activity, and the degree of normalization of the economy following disruptions associated with the pandemic. A majority of participants remarked that the risks to the employment goal had increased, and many participants noted that the risks to the inflation goal had decreased. Some participants noted the risk that a further gradual easing in labor market conditions could transition to a more serious deterioration. Many participants noted that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity or employment. A couple participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way. Several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a resurgence in aggregate demand and a reversal of the progress on inflation. These participants pointed to risks related to potential shocks that could put upward pressure on inflation or the possibility that inflation could prove more persistent than currently expected.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains had moderated, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Inflation eased over the past year but remained somewhat elevated. Members concurred that, in recent months, there had been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. Members judged that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals had continued to move into better balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.

In support of the Committee's goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. Members concurred that, in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they had gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. All members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Members agreed that to appropriately reflect developments since the previous meeting related to their maximum-employment objective, they should note in the statement that ""job gains have moderated, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low."" Similarly, to appropriately reflect developments related to their price-stability objective, they agreed to note that ""there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective."" Members also agreed to reflect the shifting balance of risks by stating that ""the Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance"" and that ""the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.""

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Effective August 1, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.
	Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.

A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, September 17, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, September 18, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.1

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Nominal Treasury yields declined notably over the period, driven by weaker-than-expected data releasesâespecially the July employment report in early Augustâand policy communications that were seen as affirming expectations that a reduction in policy restraint would begin at this meeting. The decline in nominal yields over the period was primarily attributable to lower expected real yields, but measures of inflation compensation declined as well. Broad equity prices finished the period modestly higher, while credit spreads had come off the very tight levels seen earlier this year but were still narrow by historical standards. Overall, risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion.

The manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early August. That episode saw some large moves in U.S. and foreign equity indexes, equity-implied volatilities, the dollarâyen exchange rate, and Treasury yields. These sharp moves appeared to be the result of a rapid unwinding of some speculative trading positions induced by unrelated eventsâsuch as the unexpectedly inflation-focused communications from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in late July and the weaker-than-expected U.S. employment report in early Augustâand amplified by technical and liquidity factors. All told, the unwinding process was contained, and market functioning recovered relatively quickly.

Turning to policy expectations, the manager noted that the market-implied policy rate path shifted down materially. At the time of the September meeting, the modal path for the federal funds rate implied by options prices was consistent with about 100 basis points of cuts through year-end, compared with around 50 basis points at the time of the July meeting. The average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the options-implied modal path, likely reflecting investors' perception that risks were tilted toward more rather than fewer cuts. In the Open Market Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, most respondents had a modal expectation of a 25 basis point cut at this meeting, though the manager also noted that, since the time of the surveysâabout a week earlierâthe probability of a 50 basis point cut at the September meeting implied by futures prices had increased and exceeded the implied probability of a 25 basis point cut. The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years, in line with the options-implied modal path, and was unchanged thereafter. Balance sheet expectations in the surveys were little changed from July. Most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term; the median dealer's most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the July survey and was roughly stable around current levels.

In international developments, many central banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period, with the Bank of England (BOE) deciding to initiate its rate-cutting cycle with a 25 basis point reduction and the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BOC) delivering their second and third 25 basis point cut, respectively. The market-implied expectations for year-end policy rates fell over the period for most central banks in AFEs, although by a smaller amount than they did for the Federal Reserve, contributing to a modest decline in the trade-weighted U.S. dollar index.

The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. In secured funding markets, rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repo) were higher than a few months earlier amid large issuance of Treasury securities and elevated demand for securities financing but were little changed, on net, over the period. The manager discussed the interconnections between the repo and federal funds markets, underscoring the importance of monitoring a range of indicators to assess reserve conditions and the state of money markets. Looking at a range of such indicators, the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant.

Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility declined about $100 billion over the intermeeting period, helped by an increase in the net supply of Treasury bills. With net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the September tax date before increasing again, the staff assessed that the decline in ON RRP usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year. The manager also added that, with the concentration of ON RRP usage in a small number of fund complexes, there was an increased risk that idiosyncratic allocation decisions could have an outsized effect on aggregate ON RRP volumes.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded solidly so far this year. The pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Consumer price inflation was well below its year-earlier rate but remained somewhat elevated.

Consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âwas lower in July than it had been in March, which had followed some high month-over-month changes in the beginning of the year. Monthly changes in PCE prices since April had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year. On a 12-month basis, total PCE price inflation was 2.5 percent in July, and core PCE price inflationâwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food pricesâwas 2.6 percent. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.5 percent, and core CPI inflation was 3.2 percent; both measures were well below their rates from a year ago. The staff estimated, given both the CPI and producer price index data, that total PCE price inflation would be 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that core PCE price inflation would be 2.7 percent.

Recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further but remained solid. Over July and August, average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were less than their average second-quarter pace, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.2 percent, the labor force participation rate ticked up, and the employment-to-population ratio ticked down. The unemployment rate for African Americans moved down, while the rate for Hispanics rose, and both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment edged down to 1.1 in August, a bit below its level just before the pandemic. Job layoffs, as measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits, remained low through August. Measures of nominal labor compensation continued to decelerate. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in August, and the four-quarter change in business-sector compensation per hour was 3.1 percent in the second quarter. Both measures were well below their pace from a year earlier.

Real GDP rose solidly, on balance, over the first half of the year. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)âwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumâposted a stronger first-half increase than GDP, and PDFP growth over the first half was only moderately slower than last year. Recent indicators for third-quarter GDP and PDFP suggested that economic growth was continuing at a solid pace, particularly for PCE and business investment in equipment and intangibles.

After growing at a tepid pace in the second quarter, real exports of goods moved down in July, led by declines in exports of autos and industrial supplies. By contrast, real imports of goods, especially of capital goods, continued to grow at a robust pace in July.

Real GDP growth in foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter, and recent economic indicators suggested economic growth abroad remained subdued. Although services activity and high-tech manufacturing had been relatively robust, overall manufacturing activity remained weak, in part due to restrictive monetary policies. Weakness in manufacturing was particularly pronounced in Canada, Germany, and Mexico. In China, indicators of domestic demand remained weak.

Inflation in economies abroad continued to abate, on net, though developments were mixed. In the AFEs excluding Japan, 12-month headline inflation ticked down but remained above target levels due to still-high services inflation. In the emerging market economies, inflation moved sideways, with some Latin American economies still experiencing upward inflation pressures from food prices. The BOE cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle, while the BOC, the ECB, and the Bank of Mexico eased policy further, in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets. By contrast, the BOJ continued to remove monetary accommodation.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
The market-implied path for the federal funds rate declined notably over the intermeeting period. Similarly, options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early 2025 than they had just before the July FOMC meeting. Consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path, nominal Treasury yields declined significantly, on net, with the most pronounced decreases at shorter horizons driven by reductions in both inflation compensation and real Treasury yields. Market-based measures of interest rate uncertainty in the near term rose notably, reportedly reflecting in part increased concerns among investors about downside risks to economic activity.

Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, despite a sizable but temporary drop in early August. Yield spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed, on net, and remained in the bottom quintile of their respective historical distributions. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index ended the period roughly unchanged, on net, after a large but temporary spike in early August.

Overnight secured rates were largely unchanged, and conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable. Average usage of the ON RRP facility declined as net Treasury bill issuance increased, providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds.

Market-based measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most AFEs fell notably, largely in response to declines in U.S. interest rates. The broad dollar index declined, with the dollar depreciating significantly against AFE currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the U.S. economy and AFEs. Financial markets were volatile early in the intermeeting period following the weaker-than-expected U.S. employment report and the policy rate increase by the BOJ, which led to the unwinding of some speculative trading positions. However, declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks, and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period.

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments. Rates on 30-year conforming residential mortgages and yields on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) declined, on net, but continued to be elevated. Interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels. Interest rates for newly originated commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks' books increased. Yields on an array of fixed-income securities, including investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), moved lower, generally following decreases in benchmark Treasury yields.

Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and for large and middle-market private corporations, and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid. For smaller firms, however, credit availability remained moderately tight. Commercial and industrial loan balances at banks were little changed on net. Credit remained generally accessible to most CRE borrowers. CRE loans at banks continued to decelerate in July and were unchanged in August. Non-agency CMBS issuance was robust in August, while agency CMBS issuance slipped to a bit below its post-pandemic average.

Credit remained available for most consumers, though credit growth showed signs of moderating. Auto lending continued to slow, while balances on credit cards increased moderately in July and August on average. In the residential mortgage market, access to credit was little changed overall and continued to be sensitive to borrowers' credit risk attributes.

Credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms, home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities but kept deteriorating in other sectors. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated further, with the average delinquency rate for loans in CMBS and the share of nonperforming CRE loans at banks both rising further. Regarding household credit quality, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre-pandemic lows. Though consumer loan delinquency rates remained above pre-pandemic levels, the pace of increases had slowed. Delinquency rates for credit cards rose moderately in the second quarter, while they were largely flat for auto loans.

Staff Economic Outlook
The staff forecast at the September meeting was for the economy to remain solid, with real GDP growth about the same as in the forecast for the July meeting but the unemployment rate a little higher. Although real GDP growth in the second quarter was stronger than the staff had expected, the forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year was marked down, largely in response to recent softer-than-expected labor market indicators. The real GDP growth forecast for 2024 as a whole was little changed, though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast. Over 2025 through 2027, real GDP growth was expected to rise about in line with the staff's estimate of potential output growth. The unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from 2025 through 2027. All told, supply and demand in labor and product markets were forecast to be more balanced and resource utilization less tight than they had been in recent years.

The staff's inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily reflecting incoming data, along with the projection of a less tight economy. Both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core inflation were expected to be 2 percent.

The staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside, as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected. The risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced, reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20 years.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2024 through 2027 and over the longer run. These projections were based on participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting.

In their discussion of inflation developments, participants observed that inflation remained somewhat elevated, but almost all participants judged that recent monthly readings had been consistent with inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent. Some participants commented that, though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate, slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services. Notably, core goods prices had declined in recent months, and the rate of increase in core nonhousing services prices had moved down further. Many participants remarked that the recent inflation data were consistent with reports received from business contacts, who had indicated that their pricing power was limited or diminishing and that consumers were increasingly seeking discounts. Many participants also observed that inflation developments in the second and third quarters of 2024 suggested that the stronger-than-anticipated inflation readings in the first quarter had been only a temporary interruption of progress toward 2 percent. Participants remarked that even though the rate of increase in housing services prices had slowed, these prices were continuing to rise at an elevated rate, in contrast to many other core prices.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Participants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation. These included a further modest slowing in real GDP growth, in part due to the Committee's restrictive monetary policy stance; well-anchored inflation expectations; waning pricing power; increases in productivity; and a softening in world commodity prices. Several participants noted that nominal wage growth was continuing to slow, with a few participants citing signs that it was set to decline further. These signs included lower rates of increases in cyclically sensitive wages and data indicating that job switchers were no longer receiving a wage premium over other employees. A couple of participants remarked that, with wages being a relatively large portion of business costs in the services sector, that sector's disinflation process would be particularly assisted by slower nominal wage growth. In addition, several participants observed that, with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance, wage increases were unlikely to be a source of general inflation pressures in the near future. With regard to housing services prices, some participants suggested that a more rapid disinflationary trend might emerge fairly soon, reflecting the slower pace of rent increases faced by new tenants. Participants emphasized that inflation remained somewhat elevated and that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Participants noted that labor market conditions had eased further in recent months and that, after being overheated in recent years, the labor market was now less tight than it had been just before the pandemic. As evidence, participants cited the slowdown in payroll employment growth and the uptick in the unemployment rate in the two employment reports received since the Committee's July meeting, lower readings on hiring and job vacancies, reduced quits and job-finding rates, and widespread reports from business contacts of less difficulty in hiring workers. Some participants highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate had risen notably, on net, since April 2023. Participants noted, however, that labor market conditions remained solid, as layoffs had been limited and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had stayed low. Some participants stressed that, rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor, businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings, reducing hours, or making use of attrition. A few participants suggested that firms remained reluctant to lay off workers after having difficulty obtaining employees earlier in the post-pandemic period. Some participants remarked that the recent pace of payroll increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis, assuming a constant labor force participation rate. Many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging, with increased immigration, revisions to reported payroll data, and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors. Several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data. Participants agreed that labor market conditions were at, or close to, those consistent with the Committee's longer-run goal of maximum employment.

With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to 2 percent. Participants indicated that in their baseline economic outlooks, which included an appropriate recalibration of the Committee's monetary policy stance, the labor market would remain solid. Participants agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring, with some noting that as conditions in the labor market have eased, the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration.

Participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and highlighted resilient consumption spending. A couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption, though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets, including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans. A couple of participants suggested that the financial strains being experienced by low- and moderate-income households would likely imply slower consumption growth in coming periods. Various participants reported that their business contacts were optimistic about the economic outlook, though they were exercising caution in their hiring and investment decisions. Participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments, including increases in productivity, had contributed to the recent solid expansion of economic activity, and a few participants discussed possible implications of the introduction of new technology into the workplace. Many participants emphasized that they expected that real GDP would grow at roughly its trend rate over the next few years.

Participants discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook. Almost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished, while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased. As a result, those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the Committee's dual-mandate goals as being roughly in balance. A couple of participants, however, did not perceive an increased risk of a significant further weakening in labor market conditions. Several participants cited risks of a sharper-than-expected slowing in consumer spending in response to labor market cooling or to continuing strains on the budgets of low- and moderate-income households. Risks to achieving the Committee's price-stability goal had diminished significantly since the target range for the federal funds rate was last raised, and the vast majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced. A couple of participants specifically noted upside inflation risks associated with geopolitical developments. In addition, some participants cited risks that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective could be stalled by a larger-than-anticipated easing in financial conditions, stronger-than-expected consumption growth, or continued strong increases in housing services prices.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had made further progress toward the Committee's objective but remained somewhat elevated. Almost all participants expressed greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, job gains had slowed, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to ease the stance of monetary policy. Given the significant progress made since the Committee first set its target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, a substantial majority of participants supported lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. These participants generally observed that such a recalibration of the stance of monetary policy would begin to bring it into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market. They also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation, and would reflect the balance of risks. Some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a 25 basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward 2 percent while the labor market continued to cool. However, noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low, some participants observed that they would have preferred a 25 basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting, and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision. Several participants noted that a 25 basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved. A few participants also added that a 25 basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization. A few participants remarked that the overall path of policy normalization, rather than the specific amount of initial easing at this meeting, would be more important in determining the degree of policy restriction. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation moving down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move toward a more neutral stance of policy over time. Participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants' assessments of the appropriate path. Those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive, though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness. Participants generally remarked on the importance of communicating that the Committee's monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks and therefore not on a preset course. Several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could continue for some time even as the Committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished, and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased. Some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment. A few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way. Several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a stalling or a reversal of the progress on inflation. Some participants noted that uncertainties concerning the level of the longer-term neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of policy and, in their view, made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains had slowed, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Members concurred that there had been further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks, the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent and judged that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.

In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. One member voted against that decision, preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5-1/4 percent. Members concurred that, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Effective September 19, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-3/4 to 5 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.8 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.
	Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.""


Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Beth M. Hammack, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, and Christopher J. Waller.

Voting against this action: Michelle W. Bowman.

Governor Bowman preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 to 5-1/4 percent in light of core inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, a labor market that is near full employment, and solid underlying growth. She also expressed her concern that the Committee's larger policy action could be seen as a premature declaration of victory on the price-stability part of the dual mandate.

Consistent with the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.9 percent, effective September 19, 2024. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a 1/2 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 5 percent, effective September 19, 2024.2

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on WednesdayâThursday, November 6â7, 2024. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. on September 18, 2024.

A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. and continued on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.1

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Nominal Treasury yields rose notably over the period; factors driving the increases in yields included stronger-than-expected data releases and monetary policy communications that were interpreted as signaling a more gradual pace of policy easing than previously thought. The rise at short maturities reflected increases in both real yields and inflation compensation, while the rise at longer maturities was primarily driven by increases in real yields. Broad equity prices also rose over the period, likely reflecting in part the solid incoming data and consequent lower odds of a weakening in the economic outlook. The VIX, which measures 30-day option-implied volatility of broad equity prices, had moved higher in the period leading up to the November elections and then decreased following Election Day.

The manager noted that the federal funds rate path had shifted up notably over the period, as measured by both the options-implied modal path and the futures-implied average path. Although the futures-implied path remained below the options-implied path at longer horizons, the gap between the two paths narrowed, likely reflecting market participants' judgment that risks had become less skewed toward the downside. In the Open Market Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, a large majority of respondents had a modal expectation of a 25 basis point cut at this meeting and another 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. Further out, there was considerably more uncertainty. For example, although the mean of the average respondent's probability distribution for the federal funds rate at the trough of this easing cycle was close to the average respondent's expected longer-run level of the federal funds rate, respondents placed substantial weight on a wide range of outcomes.

The manager also discussed balance sheet policy expectations. The average of the survey responses indicated that the modal expectation regarding the timing of the end of balance sheet runoff had shifted a bit later, to May 2025. These responses remained dispersed, though roughly two-thirds of respondents expected an end to runoff in either the first or the second quarter of 2025. Survey results indicated that respondents expected balance sheet runoff to continue alongside rate cuts for several more months; the surveys therefore suggested that the Committee's two policy toolsâthe policy rate and the balance sheetâwere not seen as working at cross-purposes.

Regarding international developments, the manager noted that policy rate expectations for the year-end declined in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), with the exception of Australia and the U.K. The widening of differentials with U.S. interest rates had likely contributed to an increase in the trade-weighted dollar index, which reached its highest level this year.

The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. In secured funding markets, rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repo) increased sharply and were volatile around the September quarter-end but, on other dates, generally stayed just above the rate offered at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility. Market contacts attributed the pressures seen around the quarter-end to a combination of typical balance sheet constraints associated with financial reporting dates and a large net settlement of Treasury coupon securities that took place on the same day. Overall, developments in the repo market at the end of September and in early October appeared to conform with the typical quarter-end pattern, although the spike in repo rates observed on those days was the largest in the post-pandemic period.

The September quarter-end also saw the first non-test use of the standing repo facility (SRF), with two counterparties borrowing $2.6 billion. The manager noted that the relatively small utilization was not surprising, as repo rates in the noncentrally cleared segment of the triparty repo marketâin which the facility operatesâdid not exceed the SRF rate for the most part. The manager also observed that there was a substantial volume of trades taking place above the SRF rate around quarter-end in other segments of the repo market. The manager indicated that, with dealers typically earning a spread in their intermediation activity, this outcome was not surprising. The manager suggested that considerations related to market structure also helped explain why repo rates were above the SRF rate in those segments at quarter-end. Overall, the manager judged that the SRF performed about in line with the Desk's expectations.

Usage of the ON RRP facility declined about $140 billion over the intermeeting period. This decline appeared to be driven primarily by additional net Treasury bill supply in recent weeks, which made Treasury bill yields more attractive. The manager also noted that, of late, the largest ON RRP participants had substantially reduced their participation at the facility, leading to a less concentrated configuration of ON RRP take-up than had been the case for some time.

Over the intermeeting period, pricing in the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to day-to-day changes in the supply of reserves. The manager noted that this outcome was consistent with reserves remaining abundant and that various other indicators pointed to the same conclusion.

The staff also provided an informational briefing to the Committee on two considerations related to the management of the balance sheet over the near term. The first consideration focused on the possibility of a technical adjustment to the ON RRP offering rate. The staff reviewed developments with respect to the usage of the ON RRP facility. The staff also noted that lowering the ON RRP offering rate 5 basis points would align the ON RRP offering rate with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate and would probably put some downward pressure on other money market rates.

The second consideration focused on the possible implications for the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities stemming from the federal debt limit potentially being reinstated in 2025. The staff presentation highlighted the fact that, should this event occur, a drawdown in the Treasury General Account (TGA) balances would increase the sum of reserves and ON RRP balances, and that a subsequent rebuilding of TGA balances would have the reverse effect. The staff noted that these substantial shifts could mask the effects of ongoing balance sheet runoff on money market conditions and pose challenges in assessing reserve conditions.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded solidly so far this year. The pace of job gains had moderated since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up, on net, but remained low. Consumer price inflation was well below its year-earlier pace.

Consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âhad moved lower in August and September. Total PCE price inflation was 2.1 percent in September, and core PCE price inflationâwhich excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food pricesâwas 2.7â¯percent.

Recent data suggested that labor market conditions remained solid. Average monthly nonfarm payroll gains in the third quarter were similar to those seen in the second quarter. October job gains were held down noticeably by the effects of strikes and hurricanes. The unemployment rate had edged down slightly since August and was 4.1 percent in October; the labor force participation rate also ticked down over this period, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged on net. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved down; both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment was 1.1 in October, slightly lower than its level just before the pandemic. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4 percent over the 12 months ending in October, down 0.3 percentage point relative to a year earlier, and the 12-month change in the employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers was 3.6 percent in September, down 0.7 percentage point from its year-earlier pace.

According to the advance release, real GDP posted a solid gain in the third quarter that was similar to its second-quarter pace. Real private domestic final purchasesâwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumârose slightly faster than real GDP in the third quarter. Net exports were a drag on third-quarter real GDP growth, as a brisk rise in exports was outpaced by even faster import growth.

Real GDP growth in foreign economies picked up somewhat in the third quarter, including in the euro area and, especially, Mexico. In China, growth also firmed in the third quarter, and there were signs that recent fiscal stimulus measures were starting to shore up confidence. That said, more recent indicators, such as purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), continued to suggest ongoing weakness in foreign manufacturing, in part due to monetary policies still being restrictive.

Inflation abroad continued to ease. In the advanced AFEs excluding Japan, 12-month headline inflation slowed to near or below target levels, mainly reflecting the rapid pass-through of lower energy prices earlier this year. At the same time, services inflation remained high in these economies. In China, core inflation fell to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, notably Brazil, inflation increased, partly because of renewed food price pressures.

Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank among the AFEs and the central banks of Colombia, Mexico, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand among the emerging market economies.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes increased notably over the intermeeting period amid stronger-than-expected data releases pertaining to economic activity, somewhat higher-than-expected readings on inflation, and comments by some FOMC participants that were interpreted as signaling a more gradual approach to recalibrating the stance of monetary policy. Consistent with a higher expected path of the federal funds rate and a shift in investors' perceptions of the balance of risks, nominal Treasury yields across the maturity spectrum increased significantly. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be mostly attributable to higher term premiumsâconsistent with investors' perceived shift in the balance of risks away from outcomes characterized by slower real GDP growth and lower inflation. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved up over the period from relatively low levels, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. These measures continued to suggest an expectation that inflation would return over time to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Despite higher yields, and amid greater confidence about the growth outlook and somewhat better-than-expected corporate earnings reports, broad equity price indexes increased notably, on net, over the intermeeting period, and credit spreads for both corporate and municipal bonds narrowed. The VIX rose appreciably, reportedly reflecting uncertainty about the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and escalating tensions in the Middle East. However, it subsequently more than retraced those increases, ending the period moderately lower and slightly below the median of its historical distribution.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period, with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in September fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates. Rates in secured markets exhibited significant but temporary upward pressure around the September quarter-end, driven by typical quarter-end dynamics and a large net Treasury coupon settlement. Over the intermeeting period, government money market funds (MMFs) continued to increase allocations to Treasury bills and private repo in light of the generally favorable rates on these instruments; usage of the ON RRP facility declined significantly over the period.

Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were driven by greater investor confidence in the U.S. economic outlook, foreign economic data releases, and political developments. Higher U.S. Treasury yields spilled over to foreign yields across the curve, though softer-than-expected inflation and PMI survey data weighed on short-term yields in the euro area. In the U.K., yields increased following the release of the new government's budget as market participants processed the budget's impact on projected inflation and gilt issuance. The broad dollar index increased significantly, as U.S. interest rates rose more than foreign rates. In China, the announcement of new policy stimulus measures boosted domestic risky asset prices, with limited spillovers to other markets; the announcements also drove notable flows into China-focused investment funds. Most European equity price indexes decreased somewhat, while Japanese and Canadian equity markets rose moderately.

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for households and most businesses rose over the intermeeting period from already elevated levels, primarily reflecting increases in longer-term Treasury yields. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages rose, while interest rates on credit cards remained relatively unchanged at near historical highs. By contrast, interest rates on new auto loans edged down but remained elevated. Meanwhile, interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans continued to be elevated. Yields also rose on an array of fixed-income securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, and residential mortgage-backed securities.

Over the intermeeting period, financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders remained broadly available for public corporations and for large and midsize private corporations. For smaller firms, however, credit availability remained relatively tight. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks, on net, reported maintaining their lending standards and most terms basically unchanged for C&I loans.2 Meanwhile, net growth in C&I loan balances remained subdued in August and September. With respect to commercial real estate (CRE) loans, banks in the October SLOOS reported, on balance, basically unchanged lending standards for all categories of CRE loans, the first survey since early 2022 in which standards on CRE loans of every category have not tightened. Bank CRE loan balances were flat in the third quarter, partly reflecting lending standards staying on the tighter end of the range prevailing since 2005.

Credit remained available for most consumers, although consumer credit availability continued to tighten moderately through September. Credit card balances expanded modestly in the third quarter, while auto credit growth continued to slow through August. In the October SLOOS, respondents, on net, indicated that standards for credit cards tightened, but most of them reported no change in lending standards for auto loans. Access to credit in the residential mortgage market was little changed, on balance, and continued to depend on borrowers' credit risk attributes. In the October SLOOS, banks, on net, moderately eased residential lending standards.

Credit quality remained solid in the cases of large and midsize firms, most home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities, but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained modestly above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated further, with the average delinquency rate on loans in CMBS pools rising further in September, driven largely by office loans. Regarding household credit quality, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages were largely unchanged in September at about their historical low. Delinquency rates for credit cards increased a bit further in the third quarter, while delinquency rates on auto loans inched down.

The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system's financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated, with estimates of risk premiums across key markets low by historical standards. House prices remained elevated relative to fundamentals such as rents. Although the pace of decline in CRE prices slowed, fundamentals continued to deteriorate across multiple categories.

Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial business leverage was elevated by historical standards, but the ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained strong, supported by robust earnings and the low interest rates that firms continued to enjoy on the portion of fixed-rate debt issued early in the pandemic. That said, the fraction of private firm debt having very low interest coverage ratios continued to increase, pointing to further deterioration in the balance sheets of riskier firms. Household balance sheets remained solid overall, as aggregate home equity remained high and delinquencies on mortgage loans continued to be low.

Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high; however, banks continued to hold large quantities of long-duration assets, leaving them more exposed than usual to an unexpected rise in longer-term interest rates. In the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds remained high, partly on account of the prevalence of the Treasury cashâfutures basis trade. Life insurers' leverage remained somewhat elevated, and they continued to maintain large holdings of risky and illiquid securities. By contrast, broker-dealer leverage remained low, as their capital increased in line with their assets. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were also characterized as notable. Assets in prime MMFs and other runnable cash-management vehicles remained near historical highs. Life insurers' greater reliance on nontraditional liabilities suggested that adverse shocks to the industry could trigger substantial funding pressures at these firms.

Staff Economic Outlook
The staff forecast at the November meeting called for economic conditions to remain solid. Relative to September, the real GDP growth projection for 2024 as a whole was higher, reflecting stronger-than-expected spending and labor market indicators. The staff had revised up their assessment of potential output growth in light of the upward revisions to productivity implied by the recent annual update of the national income and product accounts. From 2025 to 2027, real GDP growth was expected to be slightly slower than potential output growth, resulting in a very small increase in the unemployment rate.

The staff's inflation forecast for 2024 was slightly higher than the one prepared for the previous meeting, reflecting incoming data. Thereafter, the outlook was similar to the previous projection: Both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core inflation were expected to be 2â¯percent.

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20â¯years. The staff had reduced its assessment of the downward risks to the baseline forecast for economic activity in light of incoming data. Nevertheless, the staff judged that these risks were somewhat skewed to the downside: Although current labor market conditions remained solid, it was possible that the easing in the labor market seen over the past two years could give way to a more pronounced slowdown in economic activity. The risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of inflation developments, participants continued to observe that inflation had eased substantially from its peak, although core inflation remained somewhat elevated. Almost all participants judged that, though month-to-month movements would remain volatile, incoming data generally remained consistent with inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent. Participants commented that disinflationary progress had been seen across a broad range of core goods and services prices. Notably, in both the core goods and nonhousing services categories, prices were now increasing at rates close to those seen during earlier periods of price stability. Many participants noted that the slowing in these components of core inflation corroborated reports received from their business contacts that firms were more reluctant to increase prices, as consumers appeared to be more price sensitive and were increasingly seeking discounts. Some participants remarked that although increases in housing services prices remained somewhat elevated, they continued to expect that these increases would slow, as the more subdued pace of rent increases faced by new tenants would eventually be reflected further in housing services prices.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants indicated that they remained confident that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent, although a couple noted the possibility that the process could take longer than previously expected. A few participants remarked that insofar as recent robust increases in real GDP reflected favorable supply developments, the strength of economic activity was unlikely to be a source of upward inflation pressures. Participants cited various factors likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including waning business pricing power, the Committee's still-restrictive monetary policy stance, and well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants noted that nominal wage growth had continued to move down and that the wage premium available to job switchers had diminished. In addition, some participants observed that, with supply and demand in the labor market being roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, wage increases were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future.

In discussing labor market developments, participants generally viewed recent readings as consistent with labor market conditions remaining solid, although labor strikes and the devastating hurricanes had been important sources of temporary fluctuations in the employment data. Participants continued to cite declines in job vacancies, the quits rate, and turnover as consistent with a gradual easing in labor demand. Some participants reported that businesses were becoming more selective in hiring as they faced larger pools of more qualified job applicants, and job applicants were more willing to accept less accommodative work arrangements and more moderate wage offers. Participants generally noted, however, that there was no sign of rapid deterioration in labor market conditions, with layoffs remaining low. A few participants cited business contacts who were using attrition, instead of layoffs, to manage the size of their workforce. Some participants observed that the evaluation of underlying trends in labor market developments had continued to be challengingâ with difficulties in measuring the effects of immigration on labor supply, revisions to data, and the effects of natural disasters and labor strikes among the factors cited as complicating this evaluationâand that assessments of the outlook for the labor market were associated with considerable uncertainty. Participants generally judged that current labor market conditions were broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run goal of maximum employment.

With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants generally anticipated that with an appropriate recalibration of the Committee's monetary policy stance over time, the labor market would remain solid. Participants generally agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring. Some participants still saw elevated risks that the labor market could deteriorate, though many participants saw the risk of an excessive cooling in the labor market as having diminished somewhat since the Committee's September meeting.

Participants observed that recent data on economic activity and consumer spending were largely stronger than anticipated, and they assessed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and consumer spending remained strong. Participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market, rising real wages, and elevated household wealth. Many participants observed that recent upward revisions in data on household income and the saving rate had made these series' behavior more consistent with the strength in consumer spending. However, several participants cautioned that low- and moderate-income households continued to experience financial strains, which could damp their spending. A couple of participants cited recent increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains.

Regarding the business sector, a few participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developmentsâincluding increases in labor supply, business investment, and productivityâcontinued to support solid expansion of business activity. A couple of participants remarked that there was considerable uncertainty about the durability of recent rates of increase in productivity. Although a few participants attributed some of the productivity gains to potentially transitory factorsâsuch as one-time efficiency gains in response to earlier labor shortagesâor the possible underestimation of labor inputs, some participants highlighted more durable factors, such as new business formation and investment, as well as the integration into the workplace of technological advances. A couple of participants discussed some of these recent trends, noting especially possible implications of the expanded use of artificial intelligence in the workplace. Several participants indicated that their District contacts reported larger corporations and firms in sectors like financial services, construction, professional services, and technology as having a generally more optimistic outlook than smaller businesses or firms in the manufacturing sector. Several participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains due to low crop prices and high input costs.

In participants' evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as little changed, while downside risks to employment and growth were seen as having decreased somewhat. Among the upside risks to inflation cited by participants were the possibility of sudden disruptions in global supply chains due to geopolitical developments, a larger-than-anticipated easing in financial conditions, stronger-than-expected consumption, more-persistent shelter price increases, or sharp rises in insurance charges for health, autos, or homes. Some participants pointed to various downside risks to economic activity and employment, including weaker global growth, sharply worsening financing conditions due to an escalation of geopolitical tensions or a sizable asset price correction, or an unwelcome weakening of the labor market. Almost all participants judged the risks to the attainment of their dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability to be roughly in balance.

In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. A couple of participants observed that the banking system was sound but that there continued to be potential risks associated with unrealized losses on bank assets. Many participants discussed vulnerabilities associated with CRE exposures, focusing on risks in the office sector. A few of these participants noted signs that the deterioration of conditions in this sector of the CRE market might be lessening. A couple of participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in other markets. Some participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and, potentially, the overall economy; these participants noted, in particular, vulnerabilities that could emanate from third-party service providers. A couple of participants also mentioned third-party service providers in the context of risks associated with brokered and reciprocal deposit arrangements. Several participants noted that leverage in the market for Treasury securities remained a risk and commented that it would be important to monitor developments regarding the market's resilience. A few participants discussed vulnerabilities posed by the growth of private credit and potential links to banks and other financial institutions. A couple of participants commented on the financial condition of low- and moderate-income households that have exhausted their savings and the importance of monitoring rising delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans. A couple of participants remarked on the successful implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission's money fund rules, noting that it would reduce financial stability risks posed by domestic MMFs.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had made progress toward the Committee's objective but remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. In support of the Committee's goals, all participants viewed it as appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. Participants observed that such a further recalibration of the monetary policy stance would help maintain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to enable further progress on inflation. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time. Participants noted that monetary policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks; they stressed that it would be important for the Committee to make this clear as it adjusted its policy stance. While emphasizing that monetary policy would be data dependent, many participants noted the volatility of recent economic data and highlighted the importance of focusing on underlying economic trends and the evolution of the outlook when assessing incoming information. Some participants remarked that, at a future meeting, there would be value in the Committee considering a technical adjustment to the rate offered at the ON RRP facility to set the rate equal to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate, thereby bringing the rate back into an alignment that had existed when the facility was established as a monetary policy tool.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals remained roughly in balance. Some participants judged that downside risks to economic activity or the labor market had diminished. Participants noted that monetary policy would need to balance the risks of easing policy too quickly, thereby possibly hindering further progress on inflation, with the risks of easing policy too slowly, thereby unduly weakening economic activity and employment. In discussing the positioning of monetary policy in response to potential changes in the balance of risks, some participants noted that the Committee could pause its easing of the policy rate and hold it at a restrictive level if inflation remained elevated, and some remarked that policy easing could be accelerated if the labor market turned down or economic activity faltered. Many participants observed that uncertainties concerning the level of the neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy and, in their view, made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Members concurred that inflation had made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated. In discussing the Committee's statement, members agreed that it was appropriate to omit the previous reference to their greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent, as this language had been specifically associated with the commencement of policy easing in September and therefore was no longer needed. Almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. Members concurred that, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Effective November 8, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.
	Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.

A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, December 17, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, December 18, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.1

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated over the intermeeting period and were slightly higher, on net, than in early November. Treasury yields had risen notably since their trough in mid-September, with the rise in the 10-year nominal yield driven largely by increases in real yields. Liquidity in Treasury markets deteriorated somewhat following the U.S. election but remained well within the ranges observed over the past three years. With near-term measures of inflation compensation a little higher over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures little changed, the manager noted that there were few signs of concern about persistent inflationary pressures in market prices. Equity prices largely sustained the gains that they had experienced in anticipation of, and immediately following, the U.S. election.

The manager noted that market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period. Markets had almost fully priced in a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and all respondents from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants expected the same. Survey respondents anticipated that the pace of rate cuts would slow considerably in 2025, with the median respondent expecting 75 basis points of cuts for the full year; options and futures prices suggested a somewhat lower level of expected policy easing in 2025. However, in discussing both survey and market expectations, the manager noted that there was considerable uncertainty among market participants about the path of the federal funds rate in the year ahead.

The manager also discussed balance sheet policy expectations. The average estimate of survey respondents for the timing of the end of balance sheet runoff shifted a bit later, to June 2025. This shift mainly reflected revisions to estimates by respondents who had expected balance sheet runoff to end in the last quarter of 2024 or in early 2025.

Regarding international developments, the manager noted that market participants expected central banks in nearly all advanced foreign economies (AFEs) to continue to reduce their policy rates in 2025. In contrast to the U.S., market expectations for policy rates at the end of 2025 in most AFEs had shifted lower over the intermeeting period. The manager noted that this widening between U.S. and foreign interest rates appeared to be a major contributor to the increase in the trade-weighted U.S. dollar index observed over the intermeeting period.

The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates had remained stable over the intermeeting period, and with the exception of temporary pressures around month-end and Treasury auction settlement dates, rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repo) were little changed. The manager noted that, on average, market participants appeared to be expecting upward pressure in repo markets around year-end comparable with that seen at the September quarter-end. Based on term and forward-settling repo volumes, market participants appeared to have been more proactive than in recent years in preparing for the year-end, which the manager judged could help mitigate somewhat the extent of upward pressure on repo rates during that time.

Pricing in the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to day-to-day changes in the supply of reserves over the intermeeting period. The manager noted that this outcome was consistent with reserves remaining abundant and that various other indicators, as well as responses about banks' desired reserve levels from the Federal Reserve's Senior Financial Officer Survey, pointed to the same conclusion. Looking ahead, the manager raised the possibility that the potential reinstatement of the debt limit in 2025 could result in substantial shifts in Federal Reserve liabilities that could pose challenges in assessing reserve conditions.

Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility continued its decline over the intermeeting period. The recent decrease in ON RRP usage was attributable in part to increases in net Treasury bill issuance, which made Treasury bill rates more attractive. In the near term, the manager judged that ON RRP volumes were likely to rise because of an expected decline in net Treasury bill issuance and typical year-end dynamics. The manager also noted that the potential reinstatement of the debt limit could keep ON RRP balances elevated for some time in 2025.

The manager discussed market expectations regarding a technical adjustment that would lower the ON RRP offering rate to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate. Based on the Desk surveys and market outreach, most market participants expected such an adjustment at this meeting. Market participants' views varied on how much downward pressure this adjustment would put on money market rates, but repo rates were generally expected to fall more than the federal funds rate.

The manager concluded by noting that the Desk was planning to add a second standing repo facility (SRF) auction on each day of the week spanning year-end. The manager viewed these additional auctions as technical exercises that could improve the Federal Reserve's understanding of how SRF auction times can support effective policy implementation and market functioning during periods of expected money market pressures.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had continued to expand at a solid pace in 2024. Labor market conditions had eased since early 2024, but the unemployment rate remained low. Consumer price inflation was below its year-earlier rate but was still somewhat elevated.

Total consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âwas 2.3 percent in October, below the 3.0 percent rate seen a year earlier. Core PCE price inflationâwhich excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food pricesâwas 2.8 percent in October, lower than its 3.4 percent rate a year earlier. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.7 percent, and core CPI inflation was 3.3 percent; both were below their year-earlier rates. Given both the CPI and producer price index data, the staff estimated that total PCE price inflation would be reported as 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that core PCE price inflation would be 2.8 percent.

Recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased slightly further but remained solid. Average monthly nonfarm payroll gains over October and November were a little below their pace in the third quarter. The staff estimated that job gains were held down by the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes in October and were boosted by a similar amount in November after those effects unwound. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2 percent in November, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved down a bit further. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics also moved up, and both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment held steady at 1.1 in November, slightly lower than its level just before the pandemic. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4 percent over the 12 months ending in Novemberâthe same rate as in the previous month.

Real GDP posted a solid gain in the third quarter that was similar to its second-quarter pace. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)âwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumârose faster than real GDP in the third quarter. Exports rose briskly in the third quarter; import growth was even faster. In the fourth quarter, available economic indicators suggested that real GDP growth remained solid, with growth of real PDFP still outpacing that of real GDP. Imports fell more than exports in October, with real imports of capital goods dropping back after brisk growth earlier in the year.

Foreign economic growth picked up in the third quarter, notably in the euro area and in Mexico. Recent economic indicators, however, suggested much weaker momentum in foreign economies in the fourth quarter, with lackluster manufacturing activity and subdued private consumption spending. In China, growth in retail sales slowed, suggesting that domestic demand remained weak. Strength in high-tech goods production continued abroad, mainly in Asia excluding China, supported by buoyant U.S. demand.

Inflation in foreign economies continued to ease. In most AFEs, headline inflation slowed to near or below target levels, mainly reflecting the pass-through of lower energy prices earlier in the year. Services inflation, however, remained high in some of those economies. In China, inflation remained close to zero, in part due to falling food prices. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, inflation continued to increase, partly because of currency depreciation.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
The market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next year edged higher, on net, since the U.S. election, as investors assessed the implications of incoming inflation data and potential economic policy changes for the near-term economic outlook. Communications by Federal Reserve officials contributed to investors' perceptions of a slower timeline for policy rate reductions. Nominal Treasury yields across the maturity spectrum initially increased but then reversed those increases, ending the intermeeting period little changed. Measures of near-term inflation compensation moved up, while those of longer-term inflation compensation were little changed.

Broad equity prices rose, with more pronounced increases in stock prices in cyclical sectors amid increased investor optimism for corporate profits, and high-yield bond spreads narrowed. The VIXâa forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatilityâfell notably and remained well below pre-election levels.

Foreign financial market pricing reflected weaker-than-expected foreign data releases, expectations of further policy easing by foreign central banks, and potential changes in U.S. trade policy. Accordingly, foreign bond yields generally declined relative to their U.S. counterparts, contributing to dollar appreciation against most foreign currencies. Foreign equities generally underperformed U.S. equities, in part reflecting investors' expectations of economic growth diverging further between the U.S. and the rest of the world.

Many foreign central banks eased their policy rates during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank, among the AFEs, and the central banks of Hong Kong, India, Korea, and Mexico, among the emerging market economies. An exception was the Central Bank of Brazil, which increased its policy rate 100 basis points and signaled further hikes in the face of inflationary pressures.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period, with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in November fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates. Money market funds' (MMFs) usage of the ON RRP facility was lower, on average, than in the previous intermeeting period, reflecting increased holdings of Treasury bills amid sizable net bill issuance. Overall, MMF assets under management stayed near record highs. Spreads of unsecured commercial paper maturing over year-end remained within typical ranges, and global offshore dollar funding markets continued to be stable.

In domestic markets, borrowing costs for households, businesses, and municipalities remained elevated despite small declines in most credit segments. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages declined but stayed elevated. Interest rates on credit cards and new auto loans continued to be at historical highs, although interest rates on new auto loans decreased further. Borrowing costs for leveraged loan borrowers declined slightly. Interest rates on newly originated commercial and industrial (C&I) loans ticked down in the third quarter, and interest rates on short-term loans to small businesses remained unchanged. Yields on an array of fixed-income securities, including investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), decreased slightly but remained elevated.

Financing in capital markets continued to be broadly available for large-to-midsize businesses and municipalities. For small businesses, however, credit availability remained relatively tight, and loan originations stayed subdued in October. C&I loans by banks increased moderately in October and were flat through November after modest growth in the third quarter. After stalling in the third quarter, commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth picked up moderately in October and remained subdued through late November. Meanwhile, agency CMBS issuance continued to be weak in October, while non-agency CMBS issuance was strong in October and in the first three weeks of November, reflecting a high volume of refinancing activity.

Credit continued to be generally available for most households. Even so, auto loans were little changed in the third quarter, and growth of revolving credit was weak into November. Credit in the residential mortgage market continued to be readily available for high-credit-score borrowers, while credit availability for low-credit-score borrowers improved, on net, over the six months through October.

Credit quality remained solid for large-to-midsize firms, municipalities, and most home mortgage borrowers. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was generally stable. At banks, delinquency rates on C&I loans were stable and remained within the range observed over the past decade. Delinquency rates on small business loans continued to increase through October, as did delinquencies on small business credit cards through September. In CRE markets, credit performance deteriorated further as aggregate CMBS delinquency rates rose through October, driven by delinquencies on office loans. At banks, delinquency rates on CRE loans ticked up through September from already elevated levels. Regarding household credit quality, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages were largely unchanged and stood near historical lows. However, the delinquency rate on Federal Housing Administration mortgages, which are disproportionately used by borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller down payments, remained above pre-pandemic levels. Delinquency rates on credit cards continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year, while delinquency rates on auto loans were unchanged.

Staff Economic Outlook 
The staff projection at the December meeting was for economic conditions to stay solid. Given the elevated uncertainty regarding specifics about the scope and timing of potential changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies and their potential effects on the economy, the staff highlighted the difficulty of selecting and assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and featured a number of alternative scenarios. After incorporating the recent data and preliminary placeholder assumptions about potential policy changes, real GDP growth was projected to be slightly slower than in the previous baseline forecast, and the unemployment rate was expected to be a bit higher but to remain near the staff's estimate of its natural rate.

In the staff's baseline projection, the inflation forecast for 2024 was slightly higher than the one prepared for the previous meeting, reflecting upside surprises in some recent data. Inflation in 2025 was expected to remain at about the same rate as in 2024, as the effects of the staff's placeholder trade policy assumptions held inflation up. Thereafter, inflation was forecast to decline to 2 percent by 2027, the same as in the projection at the November meeting.

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as within the range seen over the past 20 years, a period that encompassed a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated. The staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecasts for employment and real GDP growth were balanced, as concerns about downside risks from a marked cooling in labor market conditions had eased in recent months. The risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside, as core inflation had not come down as much as expected in 2024 and the effects of trade policy changes could be larger than the staff had assumed.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2024 through 2027 and over the longer run. These projections were based on participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting.

In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that although inflation had eased substantially from its peak in 2022, it remained somewhat elevated. Participants commented that the overall pace of disinflation had slowed over 2024 and that some recent monthly price readings had been higher than anticipated. Nevertheless, most remarked that disinflationary progress continued to be apparent across a broad range of core goods and services prices. Notably, some participants observed that in the core goods and market-based core services categories, excluding housing, prices were increasing at rates close to those seen during earlier periods of price stability. Many participants noted that the slowing in these components of inflation corroborated reports received from their business contacts that firms were more reluctant to increase prices, as consumers appeared to be more price sensitive and were increasingly seeking discounts. With respect to core services prices, a majority of participants remarked that increases in some components had exceeded expectations over recent months; many noted, however, that the increases were concentrated largely in non-market-based price categories and that price movements in such categories typically have not provided reliable signals about resource pressures or the future trajectory of inflation. Most participants also remarked that increases in housing services prices remained somewhat elevated, though they continued to slow gradually, as the pace of rent increases for new tenants continued to moderate and would eventually be reflected further in housing services prices.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants expected that inflation would continue to move toward 2 percent, although they noted that recent higher-than-expected readings on inflation, and the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy, suggested that the process could take longer than previously anticipated. Several observed that the disinflationary process may have stalled temporarily or noted the risk that it could. A couple of participants judged that positive sentiment in financial markets and momentum in economic activity could continue to put upward pressure on inflation. All participants judged that uncertainty about the scope, timing, and economic effects of potential changes in policies affecting foreign trade and immigration was elevated. Reflecting that uncertainty, participants took varied approaches in accounting for these effects. A number of participants indicated that they incorporated placeholder assumptions to one degree or another into their projections. Other participants indicated that they did not incorporate such assumptions, and a few participants did not indicate whether they incorporated such assumptions.

Several participants remarked that insofar as recent solid increases in real GDP reflected favorable supply developments, the strength of economic activity was unlikely to be a source of upward inflation pressures. Participants cited various factors as being likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including waning business pricing power, the Committee's still-restrictive monetary policy stance, and well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations. Some participants noted that nominal wage growth had continued to move down. Further, several observed that, with supply and demand in the labor market being roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. However, several remarked that nominal wage growth remained slightly above the pace likely to be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation.

In discussing labor market developments, participants viewed recent readings on a range of indicators as consistent with an ongoing gradual easing in labor market conditions even as the unemployment rate remained low. Participants cited declines in job vacancies, the quits rate, the rate at which the unemployed were obtaining jobs, and turnover as consistent with a gradual easing in labor demand. Participants generally noted, however, that there were no signs of rapid deterioration in labor market conditions, as layoffs remained low. Participants generally judged that current labor market conditions were broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run goal of maximum employment.

With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy, conditions in the labor market would likely remain solid. Participants generally noted that labor market indicators merited close monitoring. Several participants observed that the evaluation of underlying trends in labor market developments had continued to be challenging and that assessments of the outlook for the labor market were associated with considerable uncertainty. Some participants noted that the labor market could soften further, as the recent pace of payroll growth had been below the rate that would likely keep the unemployment rate constant, given a stable labor force participation rate.

Participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and that recent data on economic activity and consumer spending in particular were, on balance, stronger than anticipated. Participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market, rising real wages, and elevated household net worth. Several participants cautioned that low- and moderate-income households continued to experience financial strains, which could damp their spending. A couple of participants cited continued increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains.

With regard to the business sector, several participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developmentsâincluding increases in labor supply, business investment, and productivityâcontinued to support a solid expansion of business activity. A majority of participants remarked that the behavior of equity markets reflected positive sentiment on the part of investors. Many participants also remarked that District contacts generally reported greater optimism about the economic outlook, stemming in part from an expectation of an easing in government regulations and changes in tax policies. In contrast, some participants noted that contacts reported increased uncertainty regarding potential changes in federal government policies. A couple of participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains stemming from low crop prices and high input costs.

In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, the vast majority of participants judged the risks to the attainment of the Committee's dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability to be roughly in balance. In particular, participants saw two-sided risks to achieving those goals. Almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased. As reasons for this judgment, participants cited recent stronger-than-expected readings on inflation and the likely effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy. Other reasons mentioned included possible disruptions in global supply chains due to geopolitical developments, a larger-than-anticipated easing in financial conditions, stronger-than-expected household spending, and more persistent shelter price increases. A few participants remarked that, in the period ahead, it might be difficult to distinguish more persistent influences on inflation from potentially temporary ones, such as those stemming from changes in trade policy that could lead to shifts in the level of prices. Most participants noted that risks to the achievement of the Committee's maximum-employment goal appeared to be roughly balanced, though some saw risks to the labor market as tilted to the downside. Participants pointed to various risks to economic activity and employment, including downside risks associated with weaker output growth abroad, increased financial vulnerabilities stemming from overvaluation of risky assets, or an unexpected weakening of the labor market, and upside risks associated with increased optimism and continued strength in domestic spending as upside factors.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally noted that inflation had made progress toward the Committee's objective but remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. The vast majority of participants viewed it as appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4¼ to 4½ percent. They assessed that such a further lowering of the target range for the policy rate would help maintain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to enable further progress on inflation. A majority of participants noted that their judgments about this meeting's appropriate policy action had been finely balanced. Some participants stated that there was merit in keeping the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged. These participants suggested that the risk of persistently elevated inflation had increased in recent months, and several of these participants stressed the need for monetary policy to help foster financial conditions that would be consistent with inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants indicated that the Committee was at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing. They also indicated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would be appropriate to continue to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time. Some participants observed that, with the target range for the federal funds rate having been lowered a total of 100 basis points with this meeting's decision, the policy rate was now significantly closer to its neutral value than when the Committee commenced policy easing in September. In addition, many participants suggested that a variety of factors underlined the need for a careful approach to monetary policy decisions over coming quarters. These factors included recent elevated inflation readings, the continuing strength of spending, reduced downside risks to the outlook for the labor market and economic activity, and increased upside risks to the outlook for inflation. A substantial majority of participants observed that, at the current juncture, with its policy stance still meaningfully restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity and inflation, including the economy's responses to the Committee's earlier policy actions. Participants noted that monetary policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, the vast majority of participants agreed that risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals remained roughly in balance. Many participants observed that the current high degree of uncertainty made it appropriate for the Committee to take a gradual approach as it moved toward a neutral policy stance. Participants noted that although inflation was on course to return sustainably to 2 percent over the next few years and the Committee was determined to restore and maintain price stability, the likelihood that elevated inflation could be more persistent had increased. Most participants remarked that, with the stance of monetary policy now significantly less restrictive, the Committee could take a careful approach in considering adjustments to the stance of monetary policy. Many participants noted that the Committee could hold the policy rate at a restrictive level, or ease policy more slowly, if inflation remained elevated, and several remarked that policy easing could take place more rapidly if labor market conditions deteriorated, economic activity faltered, or inflation returned to 2 percent more quickly than anticipated.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Members concurred that inflation had made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remained somewhat elevated. Almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. One member voted against that decision, preferring to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In light of their judgment that, after this meeting, the Committee would likely slow the pace of further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members agreed to indicate that, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. Members also judged that it was appropriate to make a technical adjustment to the rate offered at the ON RRP facility by setting it equal to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate, thereby bringing the rate back into an alignment that had existed when the facility was established as a monetary policy tool. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Effective December 19, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. Setting this rate at the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to support effective monetary policy implementation and the smooth functioning of shortâterm funding markets.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.
	Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.""


Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, and Christopher J. Waller.

Voting against this action: Beth M. Hammack.

President Hammack dissented because she preferred to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent, in light of uneven progress in returning inflation to 2 percent, the strength of the economy and the labor market, and the state of financial conditions. In her view, with the current federal funds rate not far from neutral, holding the funds rate at a modestly restrictive stance for a time was appropriate to ensure that inflation returns to 2 percent in a timely fashion.

Consistent with the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.4 percent, effective December 19, 2024. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 4.5 percent, effective December 19, 2024.2

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayâWednesday, January 28â29, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on December 18, 2024.

Return to text","Summary: The FOMC lowered the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.25% to 4.50% at its December 2024 meeting, citing solid economic activity, an easing but still low unemployment rate, and progress on inflation, which nevertheless remained somewhat elevated. While the Committee continues to aim for 2% inflation and maximum employment, it noted increased upside risks to inflation and emphasized a need to slow the pace of future policy easing, adopting a careful approach to monetary policy decisions. One member dissented, preferring to maintain the higher rate due to uneven inflation progress and economic strength.

By unanimous vote, the Committee selected the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account (SOMA).

By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Roberto Perli and Julie Ann Remache to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager and deputy manager of the SOMA, respectively, on the understanding that these selections were subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Secretary's note: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York subsequently sent advice that the selections indicated previously were satisfactory.

By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to reaffirm without revision the FOMC Authorizations and Continuing Directives for Open Market Operations.

All participants indicated support for, and agreed to abide by, the FOMC Policy on Investment and Trading for Committee Participants and Federal Reserve System Staff, the Program for Security of FOMC Information, the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants, and the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff. The Committee voted unanimously to approve those four policies.2

Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications
Committee participants began discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework. This review is focused on two specific areas: the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which presents the Committee's approach to the conduct of monetary policy, and the Committee's policy communication practices. The Committee's 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and is not a focus of the review.

In support of these discussions, staff briefings provided a retrospective on the Committee's 2019â20 framework review and summarized the experience abroad in conducting reviews of monetary policy frameworks. The staff presentation began by recapping the creation and evolution of the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and the context of the Committee's 2019â20 review. The adoption of the statement in 2012 introduced the Committee's 2 percent inflation target and codified long-standing practices followed by the Committee and, as such, was an important step in improving the transparency, accountability, and predictability of U.S. monetary policymaking. The launch of the 2019â20 review was motivated in part by a desire to evaluate the experience of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath. During this period, inflation had run persistently below the Committee's 2 percent objective, even as the unemployment rate and interest rates remained low. These developments indicated a greater risk that the federal funds rate would be constrained by its effective lower bound (ELB) more often in the future, posing challenges to the achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate goals over the medium term. The staff summarized the scope and components of the 2019â20 review, including its outreach to a broad range of individuals and groups, and the rationale behind the changes made to the statement at the end of the review.

In summarizing the international experience, the staff noted that occasional reviews of monetary policy frameworks were seen as useful in adapting to evolving economic environments, promoting transparency, and fostering public understanding and, therefore, were becoming the norm in advanced economies. Reviews abroad had covered various aspects related to monetary policy goals, strategies, tools, communications, forecasting, and governance, with some of the recent reviews giving particular attention to topics such as the experience of the COVIDâ19 pandemic, the ensuing global inflation episode, and the conduct and communication of monetary policy in times of unusual uncertainty.

Participants viewed the statement as having played an important role in building a common understanding among policymakers of the congressionally mandated monetary policy goals and of their monetary policy strategy. The statement and other means of policy communication also figured importantly in conveying that understanding to the public and helping to anchor inflation expectations, thereby supporting the effective transmission of monetary policy. Participants indicated that they were looking forward to their discussions at upcoming meetings and to hearing a range of perspectives at various Fed Listens events as well as at a planned research conference, and that they were approaching the review with open minds.

Participants noted that the economic consequences of the COVIDâ19 pandemic were largely unforeseen at the time of the 2019â20 review and that the current economic environment differed greatly from the period leading up to that review, which was characterized in part by persistently low inflation and interest rates. In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement, with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in 2020. Participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statement's focus on the risks to the economy posed by the ELB, the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment, and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods of persistently below-target inflation. Participants emphasized the need for the FOMC's monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They noted that economic uncertaintyâincluding about the values of the longer-run neutral policy rate, the economy's potential growth rate, and the level of maximum employmentâwould remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking. Participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasizedâincluding the Committee's firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, as well as the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.

Participants expected that their discussions related to the framework review would continue at upcoming meetings. They expected the review to wrap up by late summer and intended to report the outcomes of the review to the public.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes had declined moderately, credit spreads had remained very tight, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar had risen slightly. In considering the expected path of the federal funds rate, the manager noted that the modal policy rate path implied by options prices had not changed appreciably on net over the intermeeting period and was broadly consistent with a single quarter-point lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate taking place during 2025. The average rate path implied by futures prices was also little changed and was above the corresponding median rates in the December 2024 Summary of Economic Projections. The modal path implied by the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations shifted up somewhat over the intermeeting period, with respondents generally judging that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed, and was broadly consistent with market-implied paths at horizons up to early 2026. Beyond that period, however, the survey-based path was notably below the market-implied path. This discrepancy likely partly reflected positive market risk premiums as well as survey biases. In their expectations of Federal Reserve balance sheet policy, survey respondents on average saw the process of runoff concluding by mid-2025, slightly later than they had previously expected.

The manager next considered the recent behavior of Treasury yields. Longer-term nominal Treasury yields had risen sharply following the Committee's December meeting and the release of the unexpectedly strong December payrolls report. Subsequently, a partial retracing of this increase took place after consumer price index (CPI) data indicated that prices rose more slowly than expected in December. Over the intermeeting period, longer-dated Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, while shorter-dated yields were little changed. The manager discussed staff analysis that had aimed at decomposing the increase of nearly 100 basis points in longer-term Treasury yields that had taken place since mid-September 2024. That analysis suggested an upward revision in financial markets' evaluation of the path of the real policy rate required to achieve the Committee's goals, especially at longer horizons. Nevertheless, much of the increase in real yields was in real term premiums, likely reflecting uncertainty about the policy rate trajectory as well as a number of other factors. The manager noted that measures of inflation compensation had generally risen slightly. However, both survey measures of inflation expectations and pricing in the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities market remained broadly consistent with the anticipation that inflation would return to the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.

With respect to money markets, the manager noted that December's quarter-point lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate had been fully passed through to other short-term interest rates. In addition, the 5 basis point technical adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offering rate implemented in December appeared to have been transmitted nearly in full to repurchase agreement (repo) rates. Money market conditions had been orderly over year-end, with the technical adjustment to the ON RRP offering rate directly contributing to a lower rate environment by keeping repo rates below the values that would have otherwise prevailed. Throughout the week of year-end, the Desk conducted standing repo facility (SRF) auctions each morning, in addition to the regular afternoon auctions. Although there was no take-up, market contacts suggested that the morning auctions may also have helped contain year-end pressures. The manager noted that morning SRF auctions may be conducted again in the future. On December 26, a considerable volume of activity had taken place in the noncentrally cleared segment of the repo market, in which the SRF operates, at rates above the SRF rate. The manager stated that, in the future, the Desk may consider possible ways to improve the efficacy of the facility in that market segment.

The manager observed that usage of the ON RRP facility increased as expected at year-end but had declined on net over the intermeeting period. The manager also noted that a range of indicators continued to suggest that reserves had remained abundant over the intermeeting period. However, the manager cautioned that the debt limit situation may cloud the signals provided by the indicators. In addition, reserves might decline quickly upon resolution of the debt limit and, at the current pace of balance sheet runoff, might potentially reach levels below those viewed by the Committee as appropriate.

Next, the deputy manager briefed policymakers on possible alternative strategies that the Committee might follow with regard to purchases of Treasury securities in the secondary market after the eventual conclusion of the process of balance sheet runoff. These strategies would further implement the policy laid out in the Committee's Principles and Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet. The briefing outlined a few illustrative scenarios; under each scenario, principal payments received from agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities (MBS) holdings would be directed toward Treasury securities via secondary-market purchases. The scenarios presented corresponded to different trajectories of the holdings of Treasury securities in the SOMA. Under all scenarios considered, the maturity composition of Treasury holdings in the SOMA portfolio moved into closer alignment with the maturity composition of the outstanding stock of Treasury securities. The scenarios differed on how quickly this alignment would be achieved and, correspondingly, on the assumed increase over coming years in the share of Treasury bills held in the SOMA portfolio.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a solid pace in 2024. After a period of considerable rebalancing, labor market conditions had stabilized, and the unemployment rate remained low. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.

Total consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âwas 2.4 percent in November, down from its year-earlier pace of 2.7 percent. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 2.8 percent in November, down from 3.2 percent a year ago. In December, the 12-month change in the CPI was 2.9 percent and core CPI inflation was 3.2 percent; both were below their year-earlier rates. Based on the CPI and the producer price index, the staff estimated that total PCE price inflation would be reported as 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and that core PCE price inflation would be 2.8 percent.

Recent data suggested that labor market conditions remained solid and that the labor market was not especially tight. Average monthly gains for nonfarm payrolls over the fourth quarter were slightly higher than their third-quarter pace. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.1 percent in December, while the labor force participation rate was unchanged and the employment-to-population ratio moved up slightly. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved down but remained higher than the rates for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers edged up to 1.2 in December, its average over 2019, and the quits rate fell back to 1.9 percent and remained well below its 2019 average. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December, down from 4.3 percent a year ago.

Available data indicated that real GDP rose at a solid pace in the fourth quarter. Real private domestic final purchases, which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum, appeared to have risen faster than real GDP in the fourth quarter, led by continued strength in consumer spending. By contrast, monthly trade data were volatile but overall pointed to a step-down in both export and import growth relative to the third quarter.

The pace of foreign economic activity appeared to have moderated at the end of last year. Indicators suggested that in both the euro area and Mexico, economic growth had slowed notably in the fourth quarter amid lackluster manufacturing activity and subdued private consumption. By contrast, Chinese growth had picked up, in large part because of policy stimulus, and elsewhere in emerging Asia the pace of activity looked to have remained solid, supported by strong global demand for high-tech manufacturing goods.

Inflation abroad continued to ease. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), headline inflation hovered near target levels, mainly reflecting the rapid pass-through of lower energy prices in the second half of 2024. Even so, services price inflation remained elevated in some of these economies, such as Germany. In China, inflation remained close to zero, partly reflecting lower food prices. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, inflation continued to increase, in part spurred by currency depreciation.

Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank among the AFEs, and the central banks of Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico among the emerging market economies (EMEs). In contrast, amid improving economic conditions, the Bank of Japan increased its policy rate, taking a further step in gradually removing policy accommodation.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
The market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next year was little changed on net over the intermeeting period. Yields on shorter-term nominal Treasury securities edged down, but longer-term rates rose moderately. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums. Measures of inflation compensation over the near term moved up, but measures of longer-term inflation compensation remained at levels consistent with inflation returning over time to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Broad equity price indexes were little changed on net, while measures of the equity risk premium remained low, and corporate bond spreads remained compressed by historical standards. The VIXâa forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatilityâwas also roughly unchanged on net and remained at a moderate level by historical standards.

Foreign financial market moves over the intermeeting period mainly reflected developments in the U.S., including trade policy news and the relative strength of the U.S. economic data releases during the period. The broad dollar index increased slightly on net. Longer-term AFE yields edged higher, reflecting in part spillovers from higher U.S. yields. Stock price indexes increased in most foreign countries, with the notable exception of China, in which equity prices declined moderately, in part reflecting weaker-than-expected forward-looking manufacturing indicators. Capital outflows from emerging markets continued, and several EME central banks drew down their foreign exchange reserves, including their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, to resist currency depreciation pressures.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period, with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in December fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates. Rates in secured markets exhibited temporary, and typical, upward pressure around year-end. Excluding the year-end period, rates in secured markets declined somewhat relative to the effective federal funds rate, likely reflecting the effects of the nearly full pass-through of December's technical adjustment to the ON RRP offering rate and of declining bill issuance. ON RRP usage increased around year-end but declined slightly on net over the intermeeting period.

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for households and most businesses remained elevated. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages rose. Interest rates for credit cards and new auto loans declined but remained elevated relative to their historical ranges. Meanwhile, interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans remained elevated. Yields rose for an array of fixed-income securities, including investment-grade corporate bonds and senior commercial MBS tranches, consistent with movements in long-term Treasury yields.

Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders remained broadly available for public corporations and for large and midsize private corporations. With respect to smaller firms, however, credit availability remained relatively tight. Issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans moderated toward year-end, likely reflecting seasonal factors. Regarding bank credit, banks in the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported leaving their C&I loan standards basically unchanged on net over the fourth quarter.3 Meanwhile, growth in C&I loan balances picked up from modest levels. Banks in the January SLOOS reported tighter lending standards for all commercial real estate (CRE) loan categories. Consistent with tight standards, growth in CRE loans on banks' books remained subdued in the fourth quarter.

Credit remained available for most households, though standards appear to have tightened somewhat for lower-credit-score borrowers. Growth in credit card loan balances at banks picked up in the fourth quarter, but issuance of new credit cards to nonprime borrowers continued to decline. In the residential mortgage market, credit remained easily available for high-credit-score borrowers but tightened slightly in November and December for lower-score borrowers. In the January SLOOS, respondents on net indicated that standards tightened for credit cards, eased for auto loans, and were about unchanged for most residential mortgages.

Credit quality remained solid for large and midsize firms, most home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities but continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans showed some signs of deterioration but remained generally stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses ticked down but remained elevated. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated further, driven largely by office and multifamily loans. Regarding household credit quality, the delinquency rate on Federal Housing Administration mortgages edged up in November and remained elevated relative to the past few years. In contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types remained low. Delinquency rates for credit cards increased a bit further in the third quarter, while those for auto loans stayed about flat.

The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system's financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated. In contrast to valuations in equity, corporate debt, and residential real estate markets, CRE property prices have declined notably in recent years, though price indexes were about flat in the third quarter.

Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial business leverage was elevated by historical standards, but the ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained strong, supported by robust earnings and the low interest rates that firms continued to enjoy on the portion of fixed-rate debt issued early in the pandemic. That said, the fraction of private firm debt having very low interest coverage ratios continued to increase, pointing to further deterioration in the balance sheets of riskier firms. Household balance sheets remained solid overall, as aggregate home equity remained high and delinquencies on mortgage loans continued to be low.

Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high; however, banks continued to hold large quantities of long-duration assets, leaving them more exposed than usual to an unexpected rise in longer-term interest rates. In the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds remained high.

Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. Large nonglobal systemically important banks and regional banks reduced their reliance on uninsured deposits notably since the end of 2021. Though assets in prime money market funds had been growing recently, their size relative to GDP remained well below levels seen before 2016.

Staff Economic Outlook
The staff projection for economic activity was similar to the one prepared for the December meeting, with the output gap expected to narrow further until early next year and to remain roughly flat thereafter, and with the unemployment rate expected to remain close to the staff's estimate of its natural rate. For this projection, the staff had used the same preliminary placeholder assumptions for potential policy changes that were used for the previous baseline forecast, and continued to note elevated uncertainty regarding the scope, timing, and potential economic effects of possible changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies. The staff highlighted the difficulty of assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and had prepared a number of alternative scenarios.

The staff's inflation projection was also essentially unchanged from the one prepared for the previous meeting. Inflation in 2025 was expected to be similar to 2024's rate, as the effects of the staff's placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year. After that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as similar to the average over the past 20 years, a period that saw a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated. The staff judged that the risks around the baseline projections for economic activity and employment were roughly balanced. The risks around the baseline projection for inflation were seen as skewed to the upside because core inflation had not come down as much as expected in 2024 and because changes to trade policy could put more upward pressure on inflation than the staff had assumed.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of inflation developments, participants observed that inflation had eased significantly over the past two years. Inflation remained somewhat elevated, however, relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and progress toward that goal had slowed over the past year. Available data suggested that total PCE prices had risen about 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and that, excluding the volatile consumer food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. A number of participants remarked that current readings of 12-month inflation were boosted by relatively high inflation readings in the first quarter of last year, and several participants noted that cumulative inflation over the past 3, 6, or 9 months showed greater progress than 12âmonth measures. Most participants commented that month-over-month inflation readings in November and December had exhibited notable progress toward the Committee's goal of price stability, including in some key subcategories. Many participants, however, emphasized that additional evidence of continued disinflation would be needed to support the view that inflation was returning sustainably to 2 percent. Regarding the subcategories, housing services inflation, which had remained elevated for much of the previous year, had shown a decline, as had market-based measures of core nonhousing services inflation. Several participants noted that some nonmarket-based services price categories, such as financial and insurance services, had shown less improvement, but a few also observed that price movements in such categories typically have not provided reliable signals about resource pressures or the future trajectory of inflation. Several participants observed that core goods prices had not declined as much on net in recent months compared with earlier in 2024.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation would continue to move toward 2 percent, although progress could remain uneven. Participants cited various factors as likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including an easing in nominal wage growth, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations, waning business pricing power, and the Committee's still-restrictive monetary policy stance. A few noted, however, that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level. Furthermore, some participants commented that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. However, other factors were cited as having the potential to hinder the disinflation process, including the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy as well as strong consumer demand. Business contacts in a number of Districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs. In addition, some participants noted that some market- or survey-based measures of expected inflation had increased recently, although many participants emphasized that longer-term measures of expected inflation had remained well anchored. Some participants remarked that reported inflation at the beginning of the year was harder than usual to interpret because of the difficulties in fully removing seasonal effects, and a couple of participants commented that any increase in reported inflation in the first quarter due to such difficulties would imply a corresponding decrease in reported inflation in other quarters of the year.

Participants judged that labor market conditions had remained solid and that those conditions were broadly consistent with the Committee's goal of maximum employment. Payroll gains had averaged 170,000 per month over the last three months of 2024 and the unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level. Participants also noted that recent readings of indicators such as job vacancies, the quits rate, and labor turnover were generally consistent with stable labor market conditions. Participants anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy, conditions in the labor market would likely remain solid. Nonetheless, participants generally noted that labor market indicators merited close monitoring. Business contacts in a few Districts noted that they were expecting stable employment levels and moderate wage growth at their firms. A couple of participants noted that the upcoming benchmark revision to the payroll growth estimates by the Bureau of Labor Statistics could provide more clarity regarding labor market conditions.

Participants observed that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace and that recent data on economic activity, and consumer spending in particular were, on balance, stronger than anticipated. Participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market, elevated household net worth, and rising real wages, which had been associated in part with productivity gains. Several participants cautioned that low- and moderate-income households continued to experience financial strains, which could damp their spending. A few participants cited continued increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains.

With regard to the business sector, participants observed that investment in equipment and intangibles was strong over the past year, though it appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter. Some participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developmentsâincluding increases in labor supply, business investment, and productivityâcontinued to support a solid expansion of business activity. Many participants remarked that District contacts or surveys of businesses reported substantial optimism about the economic outlook, stemming in part from an expectation of an easing in government regulations or changes in tax policies. In contrast, some participants noted that contacts reported increased uncertainty regarding potential changes in federal government policies. A couple of participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains stemming from low crop prices and high input costs.

A number of participants commented on the financial conditions bearing on spending by households and businesses. Participants generally saw it as important to continue to keep a close watch on such conditions and their potential effects on economic activity and inflation. Many participants noted that certain financial conditions had tightened over the past several months. For example, longer-term Treasury and corporate bond yields and mortgage rates had risen notably. A couple of participants commented that high equity valuations or low credit spreads were providing some support to economic activity.

In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, the vast majority of participants judged that the risks to the achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability were roughly in balance, though a couple commented that the risks to achieving the price stability mandate currently appeared to be greater than the risks to achieving the maximum employment mandate. Participants generally pointed to upside risks to the inflation outlook. In particular, participants cited the possible effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy, the potential for geopolitical developments to disrupt supply chains, or stronger-than-expected household spending. A couple of participants remarked that, in the period ahead, it might be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of new government policies. Participants pointed to various risks to economic activity and employment, including downside risks associated with an unexpected weakening of the labor market, a weakening of consumers' financial positions, or a tightening of financial conditions, as well as upside risks associated with a potentially more favorable regulatory environment for businesses and continued strength in domestic spending.

In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted a range of factors that warranted monitoring. Several participants mentioned issues related to the banking system. A few commented that bank funding risks had lessened and that many banks had improved their ability to access the discount window; however, a couple observed that some banks had increased their reliance on reciprocal deposits, and that the stability of these deposits had not been tested in a time of stress. Several participants noted that some banks remained vulnerable to a rise in longer-term yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets. Several participants also mentioned potential vulnerabilities at nonbank financial institutions or nonfinancial corporations to a rise in longer-term yields or to leverage in these sectors. A few participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets. A few participants discussed vulnerabilities associated with CRE exposures, noting that risks remained, although there were some signs that the deterioration of conditions in the CRE sector was lessening. Several participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and, potentially, the overall economy. Several participants commented on vulnerabilities in the Treasury market, including concerns about dealer intermediation capacity and the degree of leveraged positions in the market. The migration to central clearing was noted by a few as an important development to track in this regard.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. With the stance of policy significantly less restrictive than it had been before the Committee's policy easing over its previous three meetings, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants observed that the Committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, with the vast majority pointing to a still-restrictive policy stance. Participants indicated that, provided the economy remained near maximum employment, they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, a majority of participants observed that the current high degree of uncertainty made it appropriate for the Committee to take a careful approach in considering additional adjustments to the stance of monetary policy. Factors mentioned by participants as supporting such an approach included the reduced downside risks to the outlook for the labor market and economic activity, increased upside risks to the outlook for inflation, and uncertainties concerning the neutral rate of interest, the degree of restraint from higher longer-term interest rates, or the economic effects of potential government policies. Many participants noted that the Committee could hold the policy rate at a restrictive level if the economy remained strong and inflation remained elevated, while several remarked that policy could be eased if labor market conditions deteriorated, economic activity faltered, or inflation returned to 2 percent more quickly than anticipated.

A number of participants also discussed some issues related to the balance sheet. Regarding the composition of secondary-market purchases of Treasury securities that would occur once the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities had come to an end, many participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate to structure purchases in a way that moved the maturity composition of the SOMA portfolio closer to that of the outstanding stock of Treasury debt while also minimizing the risk of disruptions to the market. Regarding the potential for significant swings in reserves over coming months related to debt ceiling dynamics, various participants noted that it may be appropriate to consider pausing or slowing balance sheet runoff until the resolution of this event. Several participants also expressed support for the Desk's future consideration of possible ways to improve the efficacy of the SRF.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Effective January 30, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a perâcounterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.
	Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:

Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications
Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on labor market dynamics and the FOMC's maximum employment goal. The staff briefed policymakers on the concept of maximum employment and related labor market indicators. They discussed conceptual benchmarks used in evaluating the position of the labor market relative to maximum employment and in ascertaining the interaction of maximum employment and price stability. They discussed a set of core labor market indicators used to help assess maximum employment, including the unemployment rate, job vacancies, the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, and the labor force participation rate (LFPR), and described the use of these indicators in assessing maximum employment during the pandemic-related recession and subsequent economic recovery. The staff also presented model-based analysis of simple monetary policy rules that respond to deviations of inflation from 2 percent but differ on whether they respond to shortfalls or deviations from maximum employment.

Participants generally supported the current description of maximum employment in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy as being not directly measurable and changing over time for reasons owing largely to nonmonetary factors. Participants acknowledged that it is difficult to assess maximum employment and that they have been well served by monitoring a wide range of indicators that can vary depending on labor market and economic conditions. They also reflected on how both the Committee and the public have interpreted the current description of maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal.

Participants reviewed the relationship between the dual-mandate goals and noted that those goals are not necessarily in conflict when both unemployment and inflation are low. Participants also discussed the implications of pursuing a strategy that seeks to mitigate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, as described in the statement, and the ways the public has interpreted that approach since it was introduced into the statement. Participants indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the shortfalls language. They judged that any strategy conveyed in the statement should be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They also considered the extent to which the current statement had effectively communicated the Committee's approach to achieving its longer-run goals, including the Committee's assessment of the appropriate policy responses in a period of a tight labor market.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, Treasury yields declined, equity prices fell, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. These moves appeared to reflect increased perceived risksârather than a base caseâof a significant deterioration of the U.S. outlook, as investors responded to both weaker-than-expected consumer spending and sentiment data as well as to developments in trade policy that had raised uncertainty.

The manager observed that the implied average federal funds rate path from futures had shifted noticeably lower over the intermeeting period for horizons beyond the middle of this year. By contrast, the implied modal federal funds rate path from options was little changed, consistent with the interpretation that the baseline outlook had not changed materially. The Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations told a similar story, as the median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in 2025 was little changed. The expected timing of rate cuts in 2026 and 2027 was brought forward about a quarter, but the expected terminal rate was unchanged. Survey respondents, however, attached noticeably higher probabilities to both lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth outcomes and higher inflation outcomes for 2025 compared with the January survey, consistent with a higher perceived risk of a negative supply shock this year.

Nominal Treasury yields declined about 25 basis points, on net, over the period, led by decreases in real yields that reflected lower expected real rates and lower real term premiums. Near-term measures of inflation compensation rose amid trade-related developments, while at horizons beyond a year, forward measures of inflation compensation fell. Overall, both market- and survey-based measures suggested that inflation expectations remained well anchored.

U.S. equity prices decreased notably, on net, over the intermeeting period, with particularly pronounced declines in the technology and cyclical sectors. While trade-related news had been the most prominent driver of equity price movements, the manager also noted that risk-management considerations may have led some levered investors to reduce long equity positions that were generating increasing losses, amplifying price movements. Option-implied volatility of broad equity prices increased over the intermeeting period to a level somewhat above its long-run average, and credit spreads widened, albeit to levels below historical averages.

Asset price dynamics abroad were opposite to those in the U.S. Major foreign equity indexes, including those of the euro area and China, appreciated notably over the intermeeting period, while sovereign yields increased in many jurisdictions. The dollar depreciated against most major currencies, although currencies perceived as more sensitive to higher U.S. tariff rates, such as the Canadian dollar and those in emerging Asia, were relatively little changed. Overall, market participants characterized price action across global equities, global rates, and foreign exchange (FX) as consistent with some re-allocation away from trades that had been based on expectations for continued U.S. economic outperformance relative to global peers.

The manager turned next to money market developments. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period, while rates in the repurchase agreement (repo) market varied notably, and some indicators suggested that conditions in that market had continued to tighten. The pass-through to repo rates of the 5 basis point technical adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) rate made in December appeared to have dissipated in February, even though repo rates had declined in mid-March as a result of a drop in bill issuance associated with the debt limit situation. Furthermore, the sensitivity of repo rates in the client-to-dealer segment to changes in transaction volumes had diminished relative to the spike observed at year-end but remained at levels above those that prevailed in late 2024. The sensitivity of repo rates to Treasury bill issuance had also increased in recent months. The manager interpreted these developments more as signs of continued normalization of the repo market than as a concern, but he also noted that, in the past, a tightening of the repo market had been a precursor to tighter reserve conditions.

The manager observed that the ON RRP facility had reached a post-2021 low of under $59 billion in mid-February. Abstracting from the debt limit situation, with the ON RRP facility nearly depleted, portfolio runoff was likely to translate to lower reserves in the future. Several indicators of reserve conditions continued to point to reserves remaining abundant, but the reliability of the signals provided by those indicators was starting to be impaired by the debt limit situation, which was already affecting the Federal Reserve's liabilities. The Treasury General Account (TGA) had declined nearly $300 billion since the debt issuance suspension period was declared in January. As a result, reserves were about $180 billion higher; ON RRP balances had also increased somewhat. Reserves were likely to continue to grow, except for periods around tax dates, until a resolution of the debt limit situation and then drop quickly as the TGA is rebuilt. In that scenario, reserves could potentially reach levels below those viewed by the Committee as appropriate without market indicators being able to provide much advance warning. The manager noted that either pausing or sufficiently slowing runoff would provide meaningful insurance against that possibility.

More generally, the manager also noted that slowing runoff would also be an effective wayâconsistent with the Committee's plansâof addressing the risks posed by a continued tightening of repo market conditions and a nearly depleted ON RRP facility. Desk survey results indicated that more than half of the respondents expected the Committee to either pause or slow runoff as its next move, with a majority of those leaning toward a slowdown. Many respondents also expected the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio to consist, in the long run, of Treasury securities only and to match the maturity composition of Treasury debt outstanding.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP was expanding at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level since the middle of last year. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.

Total consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âwas estimated by the staff to have been 2.5 percent in February, based on the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.8 percent in February. Both total and core inflation were little changed relative to their year-earlier levels.

Recent data indicated that labor market conditions remained solid and had stabilized. The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in February, the same as in December. The EPOP ratio and the LFPR edged down, on balance, over January and February. Average monthly gains for total nonfarm payrolls over January and February were solid but somewhat lower than their pace in the second half of last year. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.1 in February, a bit below its average over 2019, and the quits rate edged up to 2.1 percent in January but was still well below its 2019 average. The total employment cost index for private-sector workers rose 3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December, well below its year-earlier level. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4.0 percent over the 12 months ending in February, little changed from a year ago.

Real GDP growth was estimated to have been 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, and available data suggested that real GDP was still rising at a solid, though somewhat slower, pace in the first quarter. Real PCE declined in January, but retail sales and sales of light motor vehicles bounced back in February. In contrast to most of the data in hand used to estimate real GDP growth, many indicators of consumer and business sentiment had turned more downbeat over the past two months. Export growth was modest in January. Import growth was strong relative to its fourth-quarter pace, consistent with reports that some U.S. importers were stocking up ahead of prospective tariff increases.

Economic growth abroad slowed to a subdued pace in the fourth quarter, in part because of weak manufacturing activity in Europe and Mexico. Recent export data from abroad and some other indicators suggested that foreign economic growth recovered modestly at the start of this year. Other indicators, however, pointed to weak momentum in manufacturing production, especially in Canada and Mexico. In China, the authorities announced a target of around 5 percent for GDP growth in 2025, supported by new fiscal policy measures.

Inflation abroad continued to remain near central bank targets in most foreign economies. In advanced foreign economies (AFEs), total inflation ticked up, in part because of a short-lived spike in oil prices early in the year, but core inflation continued to cool as wage growth slowed. In China, January and February inflation data suggested continued weak underlying price pressures. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, inflation picked up further, in part driven by past currency depreciation.

Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank in the AFEs, and the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Mexico in the emerging market economies. By contrast, the Central Bank of Brazil increased its policy rate amid continued inflation concerns. Foreign central banks were increasingly noting that elevated uncertainty about trade policies was clouding their economic outlooks.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged higher but moved down at horizons beyond September, as ongoing trade policy uncertainty, indicators of weakening consumer and business sentiment, and some softer-than-expected economic data releases prompted investors to become more concerned about higher near-term inflation and downside risks to economic growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, although longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Nominal and real Treasury yields fell notably across the maturity spectrum.

Broad equity price indexes declined notably on net. The VIXâa forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatilityârose, on net, following disappointing economic data releases and a number of tariff-related developments, and ended the period somewhat above its median over the past few decades. Credit spreads on investment- and speculative-grade bonds widened, on net, consistent with emerging concerns about economic growth, although both spreads remained narrow by historical standards.

Foreign financial markets were affected by investor concerns about global economic growth, in part related to higher tariffs, while expectations for greater fiscal spending in some economies provided an offsetting effect. On balance, longer-term yields and equity indexes increased in most major foreign economies. Tariff-related developments led to significant volatility in FX markets, and the exchange value of the dollar declined, on net, as investor optimism regarding the relative strength of the U.S. economy seemed to have diminished.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly. Secured market rates increased early in the period, retracing the decline following the technical adjustment in the ON RRP rate in December, before declining later in the period. Treasury bill supply began contracting in late February and was expected to decline further until the resolution of the federal debt limit situation. The accompanying drawdown in the TGA was expected to boost ON RRP take-up and reserves, putting downward pressure on secured market rates; early signs of these dynamics were evident over the latter half of the period.

Borrowing costs for households, businesses, and municipalities declined. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages declined in line with the 10-year Treasury yield. Interest rates for newly originated commercial and industrial (C&I) loans moved down a bit in the fourth quarter but remained elevated relative to their historical distribution. Yields on newly issued agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) decreased but stayed somewhat above historical standards. While interest rates on existing credit card accounts remained elevated, they fell noticeably in the fourth quarter, reflecting the declines in the prime rate since the September FOMC meeting. Auto loan rates also fell last quarter but retraced some of those declines early this year.

Financing from capital markets continued to be broadly available for large-to-midsize businesses and municipalities. Following subdued corporate bond issuance in December, gross issuance was solid in January and February. Bank credit appeared to have become somewhat more available to large businesses. C&I loan balances at large domestic banks continued to grow modestly through mid-February. By contrast, credit conditions for small businesses remained moderately tight. Multiple recent surveys, including the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices and the Kansas City Fed's Small Business Lending Survey, suggested that lending standards had remained relatively tight for small businesses through December. Commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth accelerated through mid-February after remaining subdued in the second half of last year, as growth in nonfarm nonresidential loans was strong.

Credit continued to be easily available for high-credit-score mortgage borrowers. Mortgage credit availability for lower-credit-score borrowers continued to tighten slightly. Consumer credit remained generally available.

Credit quality remained solid for large-to-midsize firms, municipalities, and most home mortgage borrowers, but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds had been generally stable recently, and the performance of leveraged loans deteriorated slightly but remained solid overall. At banks, delinquency rates on C&I loans edged up in the fourth quarter but stayed just above the middle of the range observed over the past decade. Meanwhile, delinquency rates for short- and long-term small business loans and for small business credit cards ticked down in December but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated in the fourth quarter, partly driven by multifamily loans. More recently, however, CMBS delinquency rates declined in January and February, particularly among office building loans. The short-term delinquency rate on Federal Housing Administration mortgages inched down in January but remained elevated relative to the past few years. Delinquency rates on most other types of home mortgages stayed low. Delinquency rates on credit cards fell substantially in the fourth quarter, their largest decline since the second quarter of 2021, but they remained at elevated levels.

Staff Economic Outlook
The staff projection for real GDP growth was weaker than the one prepared for the January meeting, as incoming data for aggregate spending were below expectations and the support from financial conditions had lessened. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge up but remain close to the staff's estimate of its natural rate. The staff made no material changes to the placeholder assumptions for potential policies that were used for the previous baseline forecast and continued to note elevated uncertainty regarding the scope, timing, and potential economic effects of possible changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies. The staff continued to highlight the difficulty of assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and had prepared a number of alternative scenarios.

The staff's inflation projection was a little higher for this year than the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily reflecting higher-than-expected incoming data. Inflation in 2025 was forecast to be somewhat above the rate posted last year, mostly because the expected effects of the staff's placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year. After that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.

The staff assessed that the uncertainty around their baseline projection had increased but continued to view the uncertainty around the forecast as similar to the average over the past 20 years, a period that saw a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated. The staff judged that the risks around the baseline projections for economic activity and employment had tilted to the downside, as data on aggregate spending and financial conditions had come in somewhat weaker than expected and a number of indicators of household, business, and financial market participant sentiment had turned downbeat. The risks around the baseline projection for inflation were still seen as skewed to the upside because core inflation had not come down as much as expected last year and because changes to trade policy could put more upward pressure on inflation than the staff had assumed.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 2027 and over the longer run. The projections were based on participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. Participants also provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated with their projections. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting.

Participants observed that available data pointed to an economy that continued to grow at a solid pace and labor market conditions that remained broadly balanced, but that inflation stayed somewhat elevated. Participants generally noted the high degree of uncertainty facing the economy. Information from participants' business contacts and from many surveys indicated some deterioration in household and business sentiment amid heightened uncertainty about government policies. Various participants commented that high uncertainty had the potential to damp consumer spending as well as business hiring and investment activities or that inflation was likely to be boosted by increased tariffs. As a result, participants generally saw increased downside risks to employment and economic growth and upside risks to inflation while indicating that high uncertainty surrounded their economic outlooks.

In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that inflation had eased significantly over the past two years but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Some participants observed that inflation data over the first two months of this year were higher than they had expected. Among the major subcategories of prices, housing services inflation had continued to moderate, consistent with the past slowing in market rents, but inflation in core nonhousing services remained high, especially in nonmarket services. Some participants highlighted that core goods inflation had increased, and most of them noted that these increases might reflect the effects of the anticipation of higher tariffs.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that inflation was likely to be boosted this year by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded the magnitude and persistence of such effects. Several participants noted that the announced or planned tariff increases were larger and broader than many of their business contacts had expected. Several participants also noted that their contacts were already reporting increases in costs, possibly in anticipation of rising tariffs, or that their contacts had indicated willingness to pass on to consumers higher input costs that would arise from potential tariff increases. A couple of participants highlighted factors that might limit the inflationary effects of tariffs, noting that many households had depleted the excess savings they had accumulated during the pandemic and were less likely to accept additional price increases, or that stricter immigration policies might reduce demand for rental and affordable housing and alleviate upward pressures on housing inflation. A couple of participants noted that the continued balance in the labor market suggested that labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. A couple of participants noted that, in the period ahead, it could be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of tariffs. Participants commented on a range of factors that could influence the persistence of tariff effects, including the extent to which tariffs are imposed on intermediate goods and thus affect input costs at various stages of production, the extent to which complex supply chains need to be restructured, the actions of trading partners in responding with retaliatory increases in tariffs, and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations.

Almost all participants pointed out that many market- or survey-based measures of near-term expected inflation had increased recently. Participants generally noted that most measures of longer-term expected inflation remained well anchored, a factor likely to put downward pressure on inflation. Several participants emphasized that ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained anchored would enhance the Committee's ability to achieve its price-stability goal.

Participants judged that labor market conditions remained broadly in balance. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level, and nominal wage growth continued to moderate. Average payroll employment growth, while slowing some recently, remained solid. Several participants highlighted recent increases in businesses' layoff announcements and in people working part time for economic reasons. A majority of participants commented that the recent cuts in federal government jobs and to federal funding had begun to affect employment at federal contractors, universities, hospitals, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations, with many organizations that rely on government contracts having reported layoffs or pauses in their hiring plans. In addition, many participants noted that their contacts and business survey respondents reported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty. Several participants relayed reports from contacts who were concerned that restrictive immigration policies would reduce labor supply and put upward pressure on wages in certain sectors.

Participants observed that the available data suggested that the economy had continued to grow at a solid pace but that there were some indications that consumer spending growth might be moderating from its rapid pace over the previous two quarters. Several participants commented that the mixed retail sales data in January and February were consistent with consumption continuing to grow at a positive yet slower pace. Several participants noted that the recent downgrade in earnings forecasts from retailers and airline companies pointed to weaker consumer demand from both lower- and higher-income households. Participants commented on a number of factors that could restrain consumption, including weaker consumer sentiment and deteriorations in expected household financial situations, as indicated by a number of household surveys, and anticipation that the robust labor income growth and significant increases in asset prices over the previous several years might not continue. By contrast, a few participants noted that consumption spending could continue to be supported by solid growth in real personal disposable income or by a rebound in equity prices.

With regard to the business sector, most participants commented that contacts or surveys reported increased uncertainty about potential changes in federal government policies and a deterioration in business sentiment, which had led many firms to pause their capital spending plans. Several participants highlighted that the auto industry faced significant risks associated with tariffs because of its interconnected and cross-border supply chains. By contrast, several participants noted that their contacts expressed optimism about future firm profitability driven by more business-friendly regulatory or fiscal policy changes or expected productivity gains from artificial intelligence and related technologies. A few participants highlighted the strains faced by the agricultural sector, as tariffs threatened to further compress its profit margins by lowering farm export prices and raising input costs.

Some participants noted that financial conditions had tightened since the January meeting, reflecting lower equity prices and higher risk spreads on corporate bonds, but most of them commented that risk premiums in bond and equity markets remained low by historical standards or that businesses and consumers with higher credit scores continued to be able to obtain financing. A few participants cautioned that an abrupt repricing of risk in financial markets could exacerbate the effects of any negative shocks to the economy.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid elevated uncertainty around the economic outlook, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.

In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants remarked that uncertainty about the net effect of an array of government policies on the economic outlook was high, making it appropriate to take a cautious approach. Emphasizing that uncertainty, a majority of participants noted the potential for inflationary effects arising from various factors to be more persistent than they projected. With economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy restrictive, participants assessed that the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlook for inflation and economic activity. Participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and would be informed by the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased, with almost all participants viewing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside and risks to employment as tilted to the downside. Participants remarked that monetary policy was well positioned to address future developments; a restrictive policy could be maintained for longer if inflation were to remain elevated, and policy could be eased if labor market conditions were to deteriorate or economic activity were to weaken. Some participants observed, however, that the Committee may face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for growth and employment weakened. Several participants emphasized that elevated inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected.

Participants assessed that balance sheet reduction had gone well thus far. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. Almost all participants supported a slowing of the pace of runoff at this meeting. Most participants noted the importance of clearly communicating that slowing the runoff pace had no implications for the stance of monetary policy, would not affect the long-term path of the balance sheet, was a natural progression of the slowing decided at the May 2024 meeting, and was in line with the Committee's principles and plans for balance sheet reduction announced in 2022. Some participants noted that a slower pace of runoff would also help guard against reserve scarcity emerging with little advance notice during a period of potentially rapid increase in the TGA. Several participants did not see a compelling case for slowing the pace of runoff at this meeting. A number of participants commented that the Committee's existing tools could also be used to help address potential disruptions to the market for reserves. Some participants highlighted the importance of the Federal Reserve's ceiling tools and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the Desk to improve the efficacy of the standing repo facility. Several participants observed that the Federal Reserve's traditional tool of open market operations could also be used should signs of reserve scarcity unexpectedly emerge. Many participants expressed interest in continued discussion of technical aspects of balance sheet policy and tools after the framework review is completed.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Almost all members agreed to reducing the Committee's securities holdings at a slower pace, with the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities reduced from $25 billion to $5 billion and the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities maintained at $35 billion. One member agreed with the Committee's decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent but voted against the overall decision because he preferred to continue the pace of decline in securities holdings in place at the time of the vote. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Effective March 20, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in March that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Beginning on April 1, roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to these monthly caps and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly caps.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities.

Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, Alberto G. Musalem, and Jeffrey R. Schmid.

Voting against this action: Christopher J. Waller.

Governor Waller preferred no change in the federal funds target range and continuing the pace of decline in securities holdings in place at the time of the vote. This view was based on reserve balances being over $3 trillion as well as no evidence from money market indicators or his outreach conversations that the banking system is getting close to an ample level of reserves. In addition, rather than changing the pace of balance sheet reduction, he thought the Federal Reserve should rely on its existing tools and develop a plan for how to respond to short-run strains if they emerge.

Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective March 20, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent, effective March 20, 2025.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayâWednesday, May 6â7, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:25 a.m. on March 19, 2025.

A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, May 7, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1

Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications
Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on the price-stability side of the dual mandate and the FOMC's monetary policy strategy. The staff briefed policymakers on lessons drawn from the experiences of the U.S. and other economies with inflation over the past five years and the possible implications for monetary policy. The staff discussed the role of large and persistent demand and supply shifts, the way production capacity constraints amplified supplyâdemand imbalances, and the degree to which labor market tightness contributed to inflation both in the U.S. and abroad.

The staff considered the role of stable longer-term inflation expectations in limiting the magnitude and persistence of the post-pandemic inflation surge and facilitating disinflation without significant damage to the labor market. The staff also considered whether medium-term inflation risks have become more balanced around the 2 percent objective than they were during the pre-pandemic period, when the proximity of the policy rate to the effective lower bound (ELB) appeared to contribute to inflation running persistently below 2 percent. They presented model-based analysis of the costs and benefits of different inflation-targeting strategies in conditions of low levels of aggregate demand and inflation as well as in situations in which simultaneously high inflation and unemployment lead to a tradeoff between the Committee's inflation and employment objectives.

In their discussions, participants strongly reaffirmed their commitment to the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective and to the importance of longer-term inflation expectations being firmly anchored at that target rate. They emphasized that anchored inflation expectations help the Committee in achieving price stability, thereby enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment. Some participants also noted that short-term inflation expectations matter for economic decisions and can affect the persistence of inflation. Participants agreed that a commitment to its explicit 2 percent inflation objective, along with anchored longer-term inflation expectations at that level, enhances the Committee's transparency and accountability and bolsters the effectiveness of monetary policy.

Participants discussed the advantages and disadvantages of flexible average inflation targeting, under which monetary policy seeks to make up for persistently below-objective inflation to achieve average inflation of 2 percent, and flexible inflation targeting, under which policy seeks to return inflation to 2 percent without making up for previous deviations from target. Participants generally observed that when the risks of the policy rate hitting the ELB were more prominent and inflation was persistently running below the target, flexible average inflation targeting could have potentially limited the risk of longer-run inflation expectations becoming unanchored to the downside. Participants noted, however, that the strategy of flexible average inflation targeting has diminished benefits in an environment with a substantial risk of large inflationary shocks or when ELB risks are less prominent. Participants indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the average inflation--targeting language in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Participants noted that an effective monetary policy strategy must be robust to a wide variety of economic environments. They viewed flexible inflation targeting as a more robust policy strategy capable of correcting persistent deviations of inflation from either side of the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Participants also noted that the Committee's strategy should reflect its willingness to make forceful use of all available tools as appropriate should the risks of hitting the ELB again materialize.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Amid significant market volatility over the intermeeting period, longer-maturity Treasury yields rose, broad equity price indexes changed little on net, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. The manager observed that market participants appeared to interpret recently announced trade policy changes as a negative supply shock that could restrain domestic activity relative to foreign activity in the near term. The manager noted that respondents to the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations had materially lowered their gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts and raised their inflation forecasts for this year while significantly increasing the probability they placed on a recession occurring within the next six months.

The dollar depreciated substantially against most major currencies, as the trade-weighted broad dollar index declined over 2 percent. Market contacts attributed the decline to increased foreign exchange hedging prompted by heightened policy uncertainty and concerns that trade policy could pose greater downside risks to the U.S. than to other economies. The manager noted that the dollar had depreciated even though U.S. interest rates had risen more than foreign interest rates and prices of risky assets had declined, which historically have been associated with dollar appreciation. Liquidity in foreign exchange markets deteriorated but was roughly in line with the historical relationship between liquidity and measures of market volatility.

The Treasury yield curve steepened materially, as short-term Treasury yields declined about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period while longer-term yields increased on net. Measures of Treasury market liquidity deteriorated immediately after the announcement of higher-than-expected tariffs on April 2 and partially recovered later in the period. The deterioration in liquidity, however, was commensurate with the historical relationship between measures of market volatility and liquidity, and the Treasury market continued to function well. The manager noted that an unwinding of positions that had sought to profit on spreads between Treasury yields and interest rate swaps appeared to have been a factor in the deterioration of liquidity and the associated rise in longer-term yields. By contrast, positions held in order to arbitrage the basis between Treasury cash and futures prices had appeared to remain largely stable. Inflation expectations increased modestly at short horizons but remained stable at longer horizons.

While equity prices declined sharply early in the period, these movements subsequently retraced, and broad equity indexes were essentially unchanged on net. However, equity prices remained below their peak levels in mid-February, and options prices indicated greater investor demand for protection against further equity price declines. Corporate bond and leveraged loan spreads widened on net. Primary issuance had briefly paused at the height of market volatility but subsequently resumed.

Market contacts suggested that, rather than disinvesting away from U.S. assets, global investors had instead sought to increase their hedging against the risk of further dollar depreciation. The manager noted that no evidence indicated that foreign investors had sold material amounts of U.S. assets. Available data pointed to modest outflows from fixed-income securities that were largely offset by inflows into equity securities. The manager, however, observed that large global investors tend to change their investment strategies only slowly and that potential future geographic asset re-allocations will depend on the evolution of the global economic outlook.

The modal implied policy path based on options prices, which is a proxy for market baseline policy expectations, moved down some over the period and was consistent with either one or two 25 basis point rate cuts by the end of the yearâonly slightly more than at the time of the March FOMC meeting. The option-implied distribution of rate outcomes around year-end shifted to the left and became more skewed to the downside. The market perception that risks to the policy rate tilted more to the downside accounts for the fact that the futures-based expected policy path shifted down more over the period and was consistent with around three rate cuts by year-end. The median modal path for the federal funds rate from the Survey of Market Expectations was not much changed and indicated either two or three rate cuts this year. However, the survey pointed to increased disagreement across respondents as to the most likely path of policy.

Despite the volatility in broader markets over the intermeeting period, money market functioning had remained orderly. Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) were somewhat higher, on average, over the period, but there had been no significant strains in that market. A range of core indicators continued to suggest that reserves remained abundant. The manager noted some movement in one of the Desk's indicators arising from a modest increase in federal funds borrowing by some domestic banks in the second half of April; however, that development appeared related to tax flows and was not indicative of tighter reserves conditions. The manager observed that reserves stood above $3.2 trillion and were expected to increase as the Treasury General Account (TGA) declined until resolution of the debt limit situation. Take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility had increased but remained low in absolute terms. Following the FOMC's decision to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff at its March meeting, respondents to the Survey of Market Expectations moved their expected date for the end of balance sheet runoff back, on average, to January 2026 and slightly lowered their estimates for the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at the time that runoff stopped.

The manager reported that the Desk's technical exercises offering early settlement of the standing repo facility (SRF) conducted around the March quarter-end had gone smoothly and were well received. Market outreach indicated that dealers had a higher willingness to use the facility when early settlement was offered, and the Desk planned to make the addition of an option for early settlement a regular part of the SRF schedule starting in late June.

The Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. In addition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve's participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level since the middle of last year, but reported real GDP growth stepped down markedly in the first quarter of 2025.

Total consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âwas 2.3 percent in March. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 2.6 percent in March. Both total and core inflation were lower than their year-earlier levels.

Recent data indicated that labor market conditions had remained solid. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in March and April, equal to its average over the second half of 2024. The participation rate had risen 0.2 percentage point since February, and the employment-to-population ratio had edged up 0.1 percentage point over the same period. Average monthly gains for total nonfarm payrolls over March and April were solid and roughly in line with the average pace seen over 2024. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.0 in April, slightly below its average over 2019. The employment cost index for total hourly compensation of private industry workers rose 3.4 percent over the 12â¯months ending in March, well below its year-earlier level. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in April, little changed from a year ago.

According to the advance estimate, real GDP declined slightly in the first quarter. However, this first-quarter estimate was likely affected by measurement issues. Real imports of goods and services soared in the first quarter, likely driven by front-loading of importsâespecially consumer goodsâahead of anticipated tariff hikes. Given relatively tepid export growth, the net exports category made a large negative contribution to measured GDP growth in the first quarter. Based on available data, the outsized increase in imports did not seem to be fully matched by corresponding increases in other categories of spending, including inventory investment, resulting in a small decline in estimated real GDP. By contrast, real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)âwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumâposted a solid gain in the first quarter that was similar to its average rate of increase over 2024.

Indicators of foreign economic activity pointed to a moderate pace of expansion in the first quarter, likely supported in part by front-loaded demand from U.S. importers in anticipation of tariff hikes. However, more recent indicators suggested weakening momentum, notably in Canada and Mexico, amid elevated uncertainty about global trade policies. Inflation abroad was near central bank targets in most foreign economies, in part reflecting lower energy prices. By contrast, Chinese inflation remained quite subdued.

The European Central Bank, the Bank of Mexico, and several central banks in emerging Asia eased monetary policy, citing in part the prospective drag on domestic growth from U.S. tariffs. In their communications, foreign central banks also emphasized the need to maintain policy flexibility amid heightened uncertainty.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged up, on net, but declined somewhat toward the end of the year, as the announcements on new U.S. tariffs left investors more concerned about the near-term outlooks for both inflation and growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, while longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Against the backdrop of heightened volatility, yields on shorter- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities declined, but longer-term rates rose somewhat. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums.

Prices of risky assets were extremely volatile over the intermeeting period amid multiple tariff-related developments. On net, broad equity prices ended the period little changed, and the VIXâa forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatilityârose notably before partially retracing and ending the period at a modestly elevated level. Credit spreads widened, on net, especially for speculative-grade bonds, consistent with increased concerns about economic growth. Spreads, however, remained at low levels.

Tariff announcements led to a significant deterioration in global risk sentiment, which largely reversed following a subsequent pause of some of the tariffs and growing investor optimism about easing of trade tensions. On net, foreign equity prices moved down somewhat, while corporate bond spreads widened moderately. Market-based policy expectations and near-term inflation compensation declined notably in Europe. The dollar depreciated against many advanced foreign economy (AFE) currencies despite widening U.S.âAFE yield differentials. Market participants generally attributed dollar weakness to concerns about potential adverse effects of trade policy on the U.S. growth outlook.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly. While the TGA increased in the latter part of the period because of incoming tax receipts, it was expected to resume its decline. This dynamic, if realized, will boost the sum of ON RRP take-up and reserve balances until the resolution of the federal debt limit situation and will tend to put downward pressure on short-term market rates.

In domestic credit markets, most borrowing costs for businesses, households, and municipalities increased notably in response to the tariff news. Yields increased from already elevated levels for an array of fixed-income securities, including investment-grade corporate bonds and senior commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) tranches, largely as a result of higher credit spreads. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages edged down. Interest rates for credit card offers inched up in February, while those on new auto loans were little changed over the intermeeting period on net. Meanwhile, interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans remained elevated in the first quarter.

Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was generally less available in the latter part of the intermeeting period than earlier in the period, especially for speculative-grade bonds. Issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans stopped during peak market turmoil in early April but resumed as market sentiment recovered. Issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds returned at a strong pace, particularly in the first week of May, while that of speculative-grade bonds and leveraged loans remained subdued. Regarding bank credit, banks in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported unchanged loan standards across all loan categories, on net, over the first quarter.2 C&I loan balances edged down in the first quarter. Large banks reported easing lending standards or leaving them unchanged for all commercial real estate (CRE) loan categories, while smaller banks tightened standards or left them unchanged.

Consumer credit continued to be generally available for most households. Growth in consumer credit on banks' books stepped up in the first quarter, and responses to the April SLOOS showed a net easing of consumer lending standards in the first quarter. Credit continued to be easily available for high-credit-score mortgage borrowers but was not easily available for lower-credit-score borrowers.

Credit quality remained stable for large and midsize firms, most categories of mortgages, and consumer loans, but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds, leveraged loans, and private credit loans was generally stable in the first quarter. Credit quality concerns in the CRE market broadened beyond office properties. Even so, average CMBS delinquency rates were little changed in March, as declining office and multifamily delinquencies offset a rise in the retail and hotel sectors. Regarding household credit quality, the rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages continued to rise in February to above pre-pandemic levels. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types remained at historical lows. In the fourth quarter of last year, credit card delinquency rates edged down, and auto delinquency rates were about unchanged, but both remained at elevated levels.

The staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system's financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were notable. Equity valuations declined but still stood at the upper end of their historical distribution, spreads on high-yield corporate bonds widened and stood around the middle of their historical distribution, and housing valuations remained quite high amid increased risks to the economic outlook and the appearance of ebbing risk appetite.

Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. The ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt had improved slightly, partly reflecting stable earnings. That said, riskier firms continued to face high debt service costs relative to historical ranges. Household balance sheets remained solid overall, though delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans were elevated.

Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high. Banks, however, were still seen as exposed to some interest rate risk. In the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds stayed high.

Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. The liquidity mismatch of assets and liabilities at mutual funds was evident amid substantial outflows in the first week of April. Nevertheless, the outflows were not sustained and did not ultimately strain overall liquidity in the markets in which the mutual funds invest. Banks reduced their reliance on uninsured deposits notably since the end of 2021.

Staff Economic Outlook
The staff projection for real GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 was weaker than the one prepared for the March meeting, as announced trade policies implied a larger drag on real activity relative to the policies that the staff had assumed in their previous forecast. Trade policies were also expected to lead to slower productivity growth and therefore to reduce potential GDP growth over the next few years. With the drag on demand expected to start earlier and to be larger than the supply response, the output gap was projected to widen significantly over the forecast period. The labor market was expected to weaken substantially, with the unemployment rate forecast moving above the staff's estimate of its natural rate by the end of this year and remaining above the natural rate through 2027.

The staff's inflation projection was higher than the one prepared for the March meeting. Tariffs were expected to boost inflation markedly this year and to provide a smaller boost in 2026; after that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.

The staff continued to note the large amount of uncertainty surrounding trade policy and other economic policies and now viewed the uncertainty around the projection as elevated relative to the average over the past 20 years. Risks to real activity were seen as skewed to the downside, and the staff viewed the possibility that the economy would enter a recession to be almost as likely as the baseline forecast. The substantial upward revision to the inflation forecast in 2025 was judged to leave the risks around the inflation projection balanced in that year. Thereafter, the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, with recent increases in some measures of inflation expectations raising the possibility that inflation would prove to be more persistent than the baseline projection assumed.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
Participants observed that, even though swings in net exports had affected the data, the available data indicated that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions continued to be solid, but inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants assessed that the tariff increases announced so far had been significantly larger and broader than they had anticipated. Participants observed that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the evolution of trade policy as well as about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of associated economic effects. Significant uncertainties also surrounded changes in fiscal, regulatory, and immigration policies and their economic effects. Taken together, participants saw the uncertainty about their economic outlooks as unusually elevated. Overall, participants judged that downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation had risen, primarily reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases.

Participants observed that inflation had eased significantly since its peak in 2022 but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that progress on disinflation had been uneven recently, with elevated monthly readings in January and February having been followed by a relatively low reading in March. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that it was likely to be boosted by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded those effects. Many participants remarked that reports from their business contacts or surveys indicated that firms generally were planning to either partially or fully pass on tariff-related cost increases to consumers. Several participants noted that firms not directly subject to tariffs might take the opportunity to increase their prices if other prices rise. Some participants assessed that the recent increase in short-term inflation expectations, as indicated by various survey- and market-based measures, or the fact that the economy had gone through a period of high inflation recently could make firms more willing to raise prices. While most indicators had suggested that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, some participants saw the risk that they could drift upward, which could put additional upward pressure on inflation. Some participants assessed that tariffs on intermediate goods could contribute to a more persistent increase in inflation. A few participants noted that supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs also could have persistent effects on inflation, reminiscent of such effects during the pandemic. Several participants highlighted factors that might help mitigate the magnitude and persistence of potential increases in inflation, such as reductions of tariff increases from ongoing trade negotiations, less tolerance for price increases by households, a weakening of the economy, reduced housing inflation pressures from lower immigration, or a desire by some firms to increase market share rather than raise prices on items not affected by tariffs.

Participants judged that labor market conditions remained broadly in balance. The unemployment rate remained low and had stayed in a narrow range over the past year. Payroll employment gains were solid in April and at levels consistent with the unemployment rate being stable given a flat participation rate and low immigration. Layoffs remained low. Some participants noted, however, that their contacts and business survey respondents reported limiting or pausing hiring because of elevated uncertainty. Participants assessed that there was a risk that the labor market would weaken in coming months, that considerable uncertainty surrounded the outlook for the labor market, and that outcomes would depend importantly on the evolution of trade policy as well as other government policies. Nominal wage growth continued to moderate. Several participants commented that labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure.

Participants observed that the available data suggested that the economy had continued to grow at a solid pace. Real GDP edged down in the first quarter, but several participants observed that the decline may be the result of measurement issues, as a surge of imports ahead of expected tariff increases likely was not fully reflected in the data for inventories and spending. PDFP, which is often a better indicator than GDP of underlying economic momentum, rose at a solid pace in the first quarter.

Participants observed that consumer spending grew solidly in March. Several participants commented that, other than apparent front-running effects seen in some spending categories, effects of tariff-related developments were not widely evident in the aggregate consumer spending data. However, participants noted that various surveys indicated a sharp deterioration in consumer sentiment, though several also commented that consumer sentiment had not been a good predictor of consumer spending in recent years. Several participants noted that factors such as elevated economic uncertainty and a possible decline in real disposable income due to tariff-related increases in prices could lead to increased precautionary saving and reduced consumer demand. A couple of participants noted that a deterioration in financial market sentiment could also weigh on consumer demand. Regarding factors that might mitigate negative effects of tariffs on consumer spending, a few participants observed that the strength in the balance sheets of many households could help them absorb a tariff-induced reduction in their purchasing power; lower energy prices might help lessen strains on households' budgets; and households might shift spending from goods to services, which are likely to be less affected by tariffs.

With regard to the business sector, participants observed that the growth in business fixed investment was solid in the first quarter. However, participants also noted that their contacts or surveys reported sharp declines in business sentiment, and many participants remarked that those reports also revealed that many firms were pausing or delaying their capital expenditure plans amid increased uncertainty. Several participants noted that sentiment was generally downbeat among manufacturers because of a rise or prospective rise in input costs as well as concerns about potential supply chain disruptions. A few participants commented that retailers were downbeat because the breadth of tariffs made cost increases unavoidable for them. Several participants commented that small businesses could be especially vulnerable to the effects of tariffs, as they had less capacity to absorb margin reductions and were likely less able to diversify away from imported items. Several participants highlighted the strains faced by the agricultural sector, as tariffs threatened to further compress farm profit margins by lowering farm export prices and raising input costs. A couple of participants noted that their contacts in the energy sector expected growth in the sector to be limited, as energy prices had declined to near the level at which expanding capacity is no longer profitable for many domestic producers. Several participants noted that some hospital systems, universities, and nonprofit organizations were under strains due to government funding cuts and restrictions on immigration. Some participants discussed various considerations that could help alleviate anticipated pressures on the business sector, including less restrictive regulations and lower business taxes; relatively strong firm balance sheets, which could help firms absorb a tariff-related hit to profit margins; ongoing trade negotiations to lower tariffs; and increased demand directed to firms that are less affected by tariffs.

In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Some participants discussed the heightened volatility seen across a range of asset markets over the first half of April, noting that markets had continued to function and were able to accommodate a surge in trading volumes despite lower measures of liquidity. Several participants observed that resilience in the Treasury market was of special importance and had been a focus of attention for a number of years. Some participants commented on a change from the typical pattern of correlations across asset prices during the first half of April, with longer-term Treasury yields rising and the dollar depreciating despite the decline in the prices of equities and other risky assets. These participants noted that a durable shift in such correlations or a diminution of the perceived safe-haven status of U.S. assets could have long-lasting implications for the economy. While noting that asset prices had declined somewhat, several participants observed that downside risks to the outlook had increased, leading them to question whether asset prices had actually gotten closer to fundamental valuations. Some participants mentioned high levels of leverage at hedge funds or potential concerns about private credit and equity. While judging that balance sheet conditions for households, nonfinancial businesses, and banks appeared to be solid, several participants noted that an economic downturn or higher interest rates could lead to a deterioration in those conditions. A few participants commented that central clearing of the SRF could encourage its use during times of market stress, which would help alleviate such stresses.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. They noted that swings in net exports appeared to have not been fully reflected in inventory and spending data, which complicated the interpretation of the recent data on economic activity. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants agreed that with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlooks for inflation and economic activity. Participants agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further, making it appropriate to take a cautious approach until the net economic effects of the array of changes to government policies become clearer. Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants agreed that the risks of higher inflation and higher unemployment had risen. Almost all participants commented on the risk that inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected. Participants emphasized the importance of ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, with some noting that expectations might be particularly sensitive because inflation had been above the Committee's target for an extended period. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken. Participants observed, however, that the ultimate extent of changes to government policy and their effects on the economy was highly uncertain. A few participants additionally noted that higher uncertainty could restrain business and consumer demand and that inflationary pressures could be damped if downside risks to economic activity or the labor market materialized.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Recognizing the measurement difficulties induced by the unusual movements in net exports in the first quarter, as businesses apparently brought in imports ahead of expected tariff increases, members agreed to acknowledge that swings in net exports had affected the data. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members assessed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate while judging that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation had risen.

In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Effective May 8, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.""

2025-05-07,"Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications
Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on issues related to assessing the risks and uncertainty that are relevant for monetary policy and the potential implications of these issues for the FOMC's policy strategy and communications. The staff reviewed qualitative and quantitative tools that are commonly used to measure uncertainty about the economic outlook and the balance of risks, drawing on U.S. and international experience. The staff then discussed monetary policy strategies that aim to be robust to a variety of economic environments and ways in which risk-management considerations can be incorporated into monetary policy analysis and decisionmaking. The staff also considered the role of scenario analysis as a tool to communicate to the public risks and uncertainty around the economic outlook and their implications for monetary policy.

Participants noted that risks and uncertainty are important factors affecting their decisionmaking and emphasized the need for a policy strategy that aims to achieve the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability objectives across a wide range of highly uncertain developments. Participants acknowledged that risks and uncertainty about the economy are pervasive and pose challenges to both the design and communication of monetary policy. They remarked that measuring and assessing risks and uncertainty are difficult and that the Committee has been well served by relying on a wide range of indicators, as well as information from business and community contacts, to gauge evolving risks, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty.

Participants remarked that effective communications about risks and uncertainty help the public understand the Committee's decisions and enhance the transparency, accountability, and effectiveness of monetary policy decisions. Participants had a preliminary discussion about a range of issues related to enhancing the Committee's suite of communication tools, including possible changes to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and a potential broader use of alternative scenarios. Participants highlighted, however, the challenges associated with adjustments to these tools and noted that any revisions to the Committee's communication policies would need to be considered carefully and receive broad support across participants.

Participants agreed to continue their discussions of ways to enhance the Committee's communication tools and practices once they completed their review of their Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Participants expected that they would complete that review by late summer.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, policy expectations and Treasury yields rose modestly, credit spreads narrowed, and equity prices increased. Markets were attentive to the de-escalation of trade tensions; generally weaker-than-expected economic data releases, with the notable exception of the May employment report; and prospects for fiscal expansion. These factors, on net, resulted in some paring back of investors' perception of downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation. Results from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations were consistent with this interpretation: The median respondent's expectations for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for 2025 retraced some of the moves that occurred after the April tariff announcements, though growth expectations were still materially lower and inflation expectations remained higher relative to the March survey.

The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer-term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path. The rise in longer-maturity yields appeared to reflect, in part, market participants' increasing fiscal concerns: In response to a Desk survey question about the top factors behind the respondents' forecast of the 10-year yield over the next two years, the fiscal outlook was the factor cited by the largest number of respondents.

Market-implied inflation compensation for the year ahead fell about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period, while longer-term inflation compensation measures were little changed. Liquidity conditions for nominal Treasury securities had improved as volatility declined following the stress seen in the previous intermeeting period. The events of April, and the more recent focus in markets around fiscal sustainability issues, did not appear to have affected demand for Treasury securities at auction; an index of auction performance derived from a number of metrics indicated that auction performance had improved modestly over the past several quarters and was currently in line with the longer-run average.

Regarding foreign exchange developments, the broad trade-weighted dollar index fell further during the intermeeting period despite increases in U.S. equity prices and short-term Treasury yields. The manager noted that dollar depreciation continued to be consistent with larger downside revisions to the U.S. growth outlook relative to other major economies, which induced increased currency hedging flows by foreign investors in U.S. assets. The manager also remarked that the sensitivity of the foreign exchange value of the dollar to domestic economic surprises had not fundamentally changed. The available data continued to suggest stability in foreign holdings of U.S. assets.

The manager turned next to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. Rates in the repurchase agreement (repo) market were softer relative to the previous intermeeting period, including at the May month-end, as reductions in net Treasury bill issuance amid the ongoing debt limit situation resulted in increased demand for repo. With the softness in repo making the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility more attractive on a relative basis, usage of the ON RRP facility had been broadly stable, except for the typical spike at month-end. Since the start of the debt issuance suspension period in January, the Treasury General Account (TGA) had declined nearly $420 billion, ON RRP balances had increased about $75 billion, and reserves had increased $150 billion. Key indicators continued to suggest that reserves, which stood at nearly $3.5 trillion, were well into the abundant range. Once the debt limit was addressed, however, the TGA was likely to be rebuilt fairly quickly, which would drain liquidity from the system and result in fast declines in both ON RRP and reserve balances.

The manager also discussed the trajectory of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Since balance sheet runoff commenced in June 2022, SOMA securities holdings had fallen almost $2-1/4 trillion. As a percentage of GDP, the portfolio had declined to close to where it had been at the start of the pandemic. The corresponding drain in Federal Reserve liabilities had largely come out of balances at the ON RRP facility, while reserve levels had been relatively little changed over that period. Respondents to the June Desk survey, on average, expected runoff to end in February of next year, a month later compared with the previous survey, with an expected size of the SOMA portfolio of $6.2 trillion, or about 20 percent of GDP. At that point, the respondents, on average, expected reserves to be at $2.9 trillion and the ON RRP balance to be low.

The manager noted that, starting on June 26, the Desk will begin adding regular morning standing repo facility (SRF) operations to the existing afternoon operations. The additional operations are intended to further enhance the effectiveness of the SRF in its ability to support monetary policy implementation and smooth market functioning.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. The unemployment rate continued to be low, and labor market conditions were solid. Available indicators suggested that real GDP was expanding at a solid pace in the second quarter.

Total consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price indexâwas estimated to have been 2.3 percent in May, based on the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 2.6 percent in May. Both total and core inflation were lower than at the beginning of the year. Survey-based measures of short-term inflation expectations remained high, although the extent of increases in recent months had varied considerably and some measures had declined somewhat in May and June. Most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had held steady.

Recent data indicated that labor market conditions had remained solid. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in May, the same as in the previous two months. The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved down in May but remained near their levels since the beginning of the year. Total nonfarm payrolls increased at a solid pace in May, a little above the average monthly rate over the previous four months. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed job seekers was unchanged at 1.0 in May. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in May, a little lower than a year earlier.

Recent information suggested that real GDP was rising in the second quarter, after it had declined slightly in the previous quarter. Real private domestic final purchasesâwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumâhad increased solidly in the first quarter and appeared to be expanding further in the second quarter. Indicators for consumer spending, such as retail sales and motor vehicle purchases through May, pointed to solid PCE growth in the second quarter. Business fixed investment (BFI) rose markedly in the first quarter, apparently boosted by a pull-forward of imported capital goods in anticipation of tariff increases, and incoming data suggested that BFI was rising modestly in the second quarter.

International trade flows continued to be volatile amid substantial shifts in U.S. tariffs. After surging in the first quarter ahead of expected tariff hikes, U.S. importsâespecially of consumer goodsâdeclined sharply in April. That decline suggested that the front-loading of imports had stopped after the introduction of broad-based tariffs in early April. By contrast, U.S. exports firmed in April. In mid-May, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day reduction in bilateral tariffs, and recent indicators suggested that this change led to a rebound in trade flows.

Economic growth abroad picked up in the first quarter, lifted by the surge in shipments to the U.S.âespecially from Europe and Asia excluding Chinaâin anticipation of tariff hikes. More recent indicators pointed to a slowdown in foreign economic activity in the second quarter, partly reflecting lower exports to the U.S. and the effects of elevated uncertainty about the course of global trade policies.

Inflation abroad remained near central bank targets in many foreign economies, although recent data showed renewed inflationary pressures in some countries, notably in Mexico. By contrast, inflation in China remained subdued.

Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, citing concerns about economic growth and, in some cases, further progress on restoring price stability. In their communications, foreign central banks continued to emphasize the need to maintain policy flexibility amid substantial risks and uncertainty.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Despite a weakening of near-term inflation pressures, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next year increased over the intermeeting period with improvements in the economic outlook amid a general easing in trade tensions. Near-term inflation compensation declined, while longer-term inflation compensation was little changed. Nominal and real Treasury yields increased moderately, on net, across the maturity spectrum.

Consistent with improving risk sentiment from recent trade developments, broad equity price indexes increased markedly, and credit spreads tightened. Credit spreads narrowed to very low levels relative to their historical distribution, except for the lowest-quality corporate bonds, which stood close to the median of their distribution. The VIXâa forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatilityâdeclined moderately.

The reduction in trade policy tensions between the U.S. and China led to an improvement in global economic growth prospects and lifted investor risk sentiment. The military conflict between Israel and Iran left only a limited imprint outside of energy markets. On net, equity indexes and market-based policy rate expectations increased in most major foreign economies. The dollar depreciated a bit further.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable. After increasing over the previous intermeeting period because of incoming tax receipts, the TGA had resumed its decline in response to actions associated with the ongoing federal debt limit situation. Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed. Rates in secured markets were, on average, slightly below the effective federal funds rate, likely reflecting low Treasury bill supply.

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for businesses, households, and municipalities mostly edged down but remained elevated. Yields on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined modestly. Interest rates on small business loans decreased in May. Yields on higher-rated tranches of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed or increased slightly, whereas yields on lower-rated CMBS tranches declined, notably so for non-agency securities. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages were little changed and remained elevated. Interest rates on credit card offers ticked up in March and April, while rates on new auto loans were little changed in May.

Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and large and middle-market private corporations. Issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans, which slowed in April, was solid in May and early June, and private credit continued to be broadly available in April and May. Regarding bank credit, commercial and industrial loan growth picked up in April but moderated in May. Commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth was modest in April and May.

Credit remained available for most households. In the residential mortgage market, credit continued to be easily available for high-credit-score borrowers but was tighter for low-credit-score borrowers despite easing slightly in May. Growth in consumer loan balances at banks was robust in April and May.

Credit quality remained solid for large-to-midsize firms, municipalities, and most categories of mortgages, but delinquency rates continued to be somewhat elevated in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained stable in May. Delinquency rates on small business loans in March and April stayed above pre-pandemic levels. In the CRE market, CMBS delinquency rates remained elevated in May. Regarding household credit quality, the rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages remained above pre-pandemic levels in April. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types continued to stay near historical lows. In the first quarter, credit card and auto loan delinquency rates remained at elevated levels. Student loan delinquencies reported to credit bureaus shot up in the first quarter of the year after the expiration of the on-ramp period for student loan payments and were expected to climb further over the next few quarters. While delinquent student loan borrowers have not shown greater difficulty in meeting other debt payments so far, debt collections on defaulted student loans later this year could boost delinquency rates on other debt.

Staff Economic Outlook
The staff projection of real GDP growth for this year through 2027 was higher than the one prepared for the May meeting, primarily because trade policy announcements led the staff to reduce their assumptions about effective tariff rates relative to those in their previous forecast. With that improved economic outlook, labor market conditions were not expected to weaken as much as in the previous projection, though the unemployment rate was still forecast to rise somewhat through next year and to run a little above the staff's estimate of its natural rate through 2027.

The staff's inflation projection was lower than the one prepared for the May meeting. Tariff increases were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide a small boost in 2026. Inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around their economic outlook as elevated, primarily reflecting the uncertainty surrounding changes to trade, fiscal, immigration, and regulatory policies and the associated economic effects. In addition to the baseline forecast, the staff had prepared a number of alternative economic scenarios. The staff judged the risks around the projections of real GDP growth and employment as still skewed to the downside, though they saw the risk of a recession as less than at the time of their previous forecast. The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation this year could be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 2027 and over the longer run. The projections were based on participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. Participants also provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated with their projections. The SEP was released to the public after the meeting.

Participants noted that the available data showed that economic growth was solid and the unemployment rate was low. Participants observed that inflation had come down but remained somewhat elevated. Growth in consumer spending and business investment had been solid, though many participants observed that measures of household and business sentiment remained weak. Participants judged that uncertainty about the outlook was elevated amid evolving developments in trade policy, other government policies, and geopolitical risks, but that overall uncertainty had diminished since the previous meeting. Some participants commented that high uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic activity, including private-sector hiring, in the near term. Participants judged that there were downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation, but that these risks had decreased as expectations about effective tariff rates and their effects had declined from levels in April.

Participants observed that inflation had eased significantly since its peak in 2022 but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that the progress in returning inflation to target had continued even though that progress had been uneven. Some participants observed that services price inflation had moved down recently, while goods price inflation had risen. A few participants noted that there had been limited progress recently in reducing core inflation. Some participants noted that geopolitical developments in the Middle East posed an upside risk to energy prices.

In discussing their outlooks for inflation, participants noted that increased tariffs were likely to put upward pressure on prices. There was considerable uncertainty, however, about the timing, size, and duration of these effects. Many observed that it might take some time for the effect of higher tariffs to be reflected in the prices of final goods because firms might choose not to raise prices on affected goods and services until they had run down inventories of products imported before the increase in tariffs or because it would take some time for tariffs on intermediate goods to work through the supply chain. Several participants commented that upward pressure on prices could be greater if tariffs disrupted supply chains or acted as a drag on productivity. Many participants noted that the eventual effect of tariffs on inflation could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon, if firms are able to quickly adjust their supply chains, or if firms can use other margins of adjustment to reduce their exposure to the effects of tariffs. Several participants noted that firms not directly subject to tariffs might take the opportunity to increase their prices if other prices rise, particularly those of complementary products. Participants relayed a range of assessments from their business contacts regarding the extent to which tariff-related cost increases would be passed on to consumers. Several participants observed that the pass-through of tariffs might be limited if households and businesses exhibit a low tolerance for price hikes or if firms seek to increase their market share as others raise their prices. A few participants noted that the pass-through of tariff-related costs likely would be greater for smaller businesses or businesses with narrow profit margins.

Participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important they remain so. Several participants commented that shorter-term inflation expectations had been elevated and that this development had the potential to spill over into longer-term expectations or to affect price and wage setting in the near term. While a few participants noted that tariffs would lead to a one-time increase in prices and would not affect longer-term inflation expectations, most participants noted the risk that tariffs could have more persistent effects on inflation, and some highlighted the fact that such persistence could also affect inflation expectations. Some participants observed that because inflation has been elevated for some time, there was a heightened risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored if there is a long-lasting rise in inflation.

In their discussion of the labor market, participants judged that conditions remained solid and that the labor market was at, or near, estimates of maximum employment. Several participants observed that the recent stability of the labor market reflected a slowing in both hiring and layoffs, and several participants also mentioned that their contacts and business survey respondents reported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated uncertainty. Several participants noted that immigration policies were reducing labor supply. In their outlook for the labor market, most participants suggested that higher tariffs or heightened policy uncertainty would weigh on labor demand, and many participants expected a gradual softening of conditions. A few participants noted that some indicators already provided signs of softness and that they would be attentive to indications of further labor market weakening. Some participants observed that wage growth had continued to moderate and that it was not expected to contribute to inflationary pressures.

Participants judged that economic activity had continued to grow at a solid pace, although uncertainty remained elevated. The outlook was for continued economic growth, although a majority of participants expected that the pace of growth was likely to moderate going forward. Regarding the household sector, several participants observed that some recent data indicated continued solid consumer spending growth, whereas several other participants pointed to other data that suggested softening. Several participants noted that lower- and moderate-income households were switching to lower-cost items and brands or that these households could be disproportionately affected by tariff-related price increases. Many participants observed that measures of household sentiment remained low, although these measures had risen a bit recently. A few participants noted that consumer sentiment had not been a good predictor of consumer spending in recent years.

In their discussion of the business sector, participants noted that activity remained solid, although there have been signs of softening, and many observed that indicators of business sentiment remained low. With respect to investment spending, several participants reported that business contacts had indicated that their firms were proceeding with existing investment projects but that heightened uncertainty was making them cautious about beginning new projects, especially larger ones; some smaller new investments or those with more certain payoffs were still being undertaken. Several participants noted that financing from both banks and financial markets was readily available for larger investment projects. A couple of participants noted that business investment in artificial intelligence could boost productivity. Several participants commented that there had been signs of softening production activity in the manufacturing sector and pointed to reductions in orders and shipments in manufacturing surveys or in reports of business contacts. A couple of participants noted that the agricultural sector faced strains from low crop prices and high input costs.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Participants observed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished amid a reduction in announced and expected tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined, but that overall uncertainty continued to be elevated. All participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally agreed that, with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlook for inflation and economic activity. Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate, noting that upward pressure on inflation from tariffs may be temporary or modest, that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored, or that some weakening of economic activity and labor market conditions could occur. A couple of participants noted that, if the data evolve in line with their expectations, they would be open to considering a reduction in the target range for the policy rate as soon as at the next meeting. Some participants saw the most likely appropriate path of monetary policy as involving no reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate this year, noting that recent inflation readings had continued to exceed the Committee's 2 percent goal, that upside risks to inflation remained meaningful in light of factors such as elevated short-term inflation expectations of businesses and households, or that they expected that the economy would remain resilient. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level.

Various participants discussed risks that, if realized, would have the potential to affect the appropriate path of monetary policy. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants noted that, if the imposition of tariffs were to generate a larger-than-expected increase in inflation, if such an increase in inflation were to be more persistent than anticipated, or if a notable increase in medium- or longer-term inflation expectations were to occur, then it would be appropriate to maintain a more restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case, especially if labor market conditions and economic activity remained solid. By contrast, if labor market conditions or economic activity were to weaken materially, or if inflation were to continue to come down and inflation expectations remained well anchored, then it would be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for employment weakened. If that were to occur, participants agreed that they would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.

In considering the likelihood of various scenarios, participants agreed that the risks of higher inflation and weaker labor market conditions had diminished but remained elevated, citing a lower expected path of tariffs, encouraging recent readings on inflation and inflation expectations, resilience in consumer and business spending, or improvements in some measures of consumer or business sentiment. Some participants commented that they saw the risk of elevated inflation as remaining more prominent, or as having diminished by less, than risks to employment. A few participants saw risks to the labor market as having become predominant. They noted some recent signs of weakening in real activity or the labor market, or commented that conditions could weaken in the future, particularly if policy were to remain restrictive. Participants agreed that although uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook had decreased, it remained appropriate to take a careful approach in adjusting monetary policy. Participants emphasized the importance of ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and agreed that the current stance of monetary policy positioned the Committee well to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished but remained elevated, and the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. The assessment that uncertainty had declined reflected, in part, a reduction in the expected level of tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined.

In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Members agreed that, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:

	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.""



The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.""

A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, July 30, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1

Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications
Participants continued their discussion related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices (framework review). They observed that they had made important progress toward revising the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (consensus statement). Participants discussed potential revisions to the consensus statement that would incorporate lessons learned from economic developments since the 2020 framework review and would be designed to be robust across a wide range of economic conditions. Participants noted that the Committee was close to finalizing changes to the consensus statement and would do so in the near future.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, the expected path of the policy rate and longer-term Treasury yields were little changed, equity prices increased, credit spreads narrowed, and the dollar depreciated slightly. The manager noted that markets continued to be attentive to news related to trade policy, though markets' reaction to incoming information on this topic was more restrained than in April and May. Against this backdrop, the manager reported that the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations (Desk survey) indicated that the median respondent's expectations regarding both real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and inflation were roughly unchanged.

The manager turned next to policy rate expectations, which held steady over the intermeeting period, consistent with a relatively stable macroeconomic outlook. The median modal path of the federal funds rate, as given in the Desk survey, was unchanged from the corresponding path in the June survey and continued to indicate expectations of two 25 basis point rate cuts in the second half of this year. Market-based measures of policy rate expectations were also little changed and indicated expectations of one to two 25 basis point rate cuts by the end of the year.

The manager then discussed developments in Treasury securities markets and market-based measures of inflation compensation. Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, consistent with the lack of appreciable changes in the macroeconomic outlook and in policy rate expectations. Perceived risks associated with trade policy developments contributed to an increase in near-term market measures of inflation compensation, while longer-horizon measures of inflation compensation rose more modestly.

The manager then turned to market pricing of risky assets. The increases in equity prices and narrowing of credit spreads suggested that markets assessed that the overall U.S. economy was remaining resilient; still, financial markets appeared to be making distinctions between individual corporations on the basis of the size and quality of their earnings. Valuations of the S&P 500 index continued to move above long-run average levels, mostly driven by optimism about the largest technology firms' scope to benefit from the further adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). However, valuations of an index of smaller-capitalization firms, although higher over the intermeeting period, remained below their historical averages.

Regarding foreign exchange developments, the manager noted that the broad trade-weighted dollar index had continued to depreciate since the previous FOMC meeting but at a slower pace than in recent intermeeting periods. At the same time, the manager noted that correlations between the dollar and its fundamental drivers had normalized recently. The available data continued to suggest relative stability in foreign holdings of U.S. assets.

The manager turned next to money markets. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) were somewhat higher than the low levels seen in the previous intermeeting period. The manager observed that two factors contributed to this slight increase: the normal upward pressure on money market rates associated with the June quarter-end; and the rise in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding of the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance following the increase in the debt limit in early July. On June 30, as market rates climbed modestly above the standing repo facility's (SRF) minimum bid rate at quarter-end, there was material usage of the facility, with counterparties borrowing a bit more than $11 billion, the highest utilization to date.

The manager also discussed the projected trajectory of various Federal Reserve liabilities. With increased Treasury bill issuance associated with the rebuilding of the TGA balance likely to result in a rise in money market rates, take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility was expected to decline to low levels relatively soon. Market indicators continued to suggest that reserves remained abundant; however, ongoing System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio runoff, a substantial expected increase in the TGA balance, and the depletion of the ON RRP facility were together likely to bring about a sustained decline in reserves for the first time since portfolio runoff started in June 2022. Against this backdrop, the staff would continue to monitor indicators of reserve conditions closely. The manager also noted that there would be timesâsuch as quarter-ends, tax dates, and days associated with large settlements of Treasury securitiesâwhen reserves were likely to dip temporarily to even lower levels. At those times, utilization of the SRF would likely support the smooth functioning of money markets and the implementation of monetary policy.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP expanded at a tepid pace in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate continued to be low, and consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.

Disinflation appeared to have stalled, with tariffs putting upward pressure on goods price inflation. Total consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)âwas estimated to have been 2.5 percent in June, based on the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.7 percent in June. Both inflation rates were similar to their year-earlier levels.

Recent data indicated that labor market conditions remained solid. The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in June, down 0.1 percentage point from May. The participation rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in June, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. Total nonfarm payroll gains were solid in June, though the pace of private payroll gains stepped down noticeably. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.1 in June and remained within the narrow range seen over the past year. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.7 percent over the 12 months ending in June, slightly lower than the year-earlier pace.

According to the advance estimate, real GDP rose in the second quarter after declining in the first quarter. Growth of real private domestic final purchasesâwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumâslowed in the second quarter, as a step-down in investment growth offset faster PCE growth.

After exerting a substantial negative drag on GDP growth in the first quarter, net exports made a large positive contribution in the second quarter. Real imports of goods and services declined sharply, likely reflecting the aftereffects of the substantial front-loading of imports recorded in the first quarter ahead of anticipated tariff hikes. By contrast, exports of goods declined at a more moderate pace, and exports of services rose further.

Abroad, activity indicators pointed to a slowdown of foreign economic growth in the second quarter, as the transitory boost due to the front-loading of U.S. imports earlier in the year faded. Of note, monthly GDP data through May indicated that economic activity contracted in Canada. China's GDP, however, continued to expand at a moderate pace in the second quarter, supported by solid domestic spending.

Headline inflation rates were near targets in most foreign economies, held down by past declines in oil prices and fading wage pressures following a tightening in monetary policy stances over the past few years. However, core inflation remained somewhat elevated in some foreign economies.

Over the intermeeting period, several foreign central banks, such as the Bank of Mexico and the Swiss National Bank, further eased their monetary policy stance, while others, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, held their policy rates steady. In their communications, foreign central banks continued to emphasize that U.S. trade policies and accompanying uncertainty have started to weigh on economic activity in their economies.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Over the intermeeting period, both the market-implied expected path of the federal funds rate over the next year and nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, while real yields declined. Inflation compensation rose across the maturity spectrumâparticularly at shorter horizonsâreflecting, at least in part, perceived risks associated with trade policy developments.

Broad equity price indexes increased and credit spreads tightened, consistent with improving risk sentiment attributed in part to easing geopolitical tensions as well as stronger-than-expected economic activity. Credit spreads for all rating categories except the lowest-quality bonds narrowed to exceptionally low levels relative to their historical distribution. The VIXâa forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatilityâdeclined moderately to just below the median of its historical distribution.

Over the intermeeting period, news about trade policy interpreted as positive by investors together with some easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East led to moderate increases in foreign equity prices and longer-term yields. The broad dollar index was little changed on net.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period while displaying typical quarter-end dynamics. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which became law on July 4, ended the previous debt issuance suspension period, after which the TGA balance increased from $313 billion on July 3 to an expected $500 billion by the end of July. Rates in secured markets were, on average, somewhat elevated relative to the average over the previous intermeeting period, owing in part to quarter-end effects. Although upward pressure on repo rates was modest at quarter-end, take-up at the SRF was $11.1 billion on June 30âits highest level since the inception of the facilityâas the addition of an early settlement option seemed to encourage participation. Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed over the intermeeting period.

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs facing businesses, households, and municipalities eased moderately but remained elevated relative to post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) average levels. Yields on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined modestly, while interest rates on small business loans were little changed on net. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages were little changed and remained near the top of the post-GFC historical distribution. Interest rates on new auto loans and for new credit card offers have fluctuated in a narrow range in recent months around the upper end of their post-GFC distributions.

Credit remained generally available. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations as well as large and middle-market private corporations. Issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans was solid in June, and private credit continued to be broadly available despite ebbing somewhat in May and June. Loan balances on banks' books increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter, led by growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. Lending to small businesses remained subdued, an outcome attributed to weak borrower demand.

Banks in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported that, on net, underwriting standards were little changed in the second quarter across most loan categories, although the level of standards remained on the tighter end of their historical range. C&I loan standards, however, were reported to be a little easier than the range seen since 2005, yet still somewhat tighter than in periods not associated with financial stress. Consumer credit continued to be readily available for high-credit-score borrowers, though growth in applications for home purchases, refinances, auto loans, and revolving credit was relatively weak, reflecting heightened borrowing costs and tighter credit standards for lower-credit-score borrowers.

In the second quarter, credit performance was generally stable but somewhat weaker than pre-pandemic levels. Corporate bond and leveraged loan credit performance declined moderately in May and June, though defaults remained below post-GFC medians through June. In the commercial real estate market, delinquency rates on commercial mortgage-backed securities remained elevated through June. The rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages continued to be elevated. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types continued to stay near historical lows. In May, the credit card delinquency rate was a little below its year-earlier value, while that for auto loans was roughly the same as in May last year; both were elevated relative to their pre-pandemic levels. Student loan delinquencies reported to credit bureaus shot up in the first quarter of the year after the expiration of the on-ramp period for student loan payments.

The staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system's financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated. In equity markets, price-to-earnings ratios stood at the upper end of their historical distribution, while spreads on high-yield corporate bonds narrowed notably and were low relative to their historical distribution. Housing valuations edged down but remained elevated.

Vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Household debt to GDP was at its lowest level in the past 20 years, and household balance sheets remained strong. The ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained solid. For private firms, debt grew at a rapid pace, while these firms' interest coverage ratios declined to the lower range of their historical distributions, suggesting that vulnerabilities may be growing in that sector.

Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high, while recent annual supervisory stress-test results showed that all participants stayed above minimum capital requirements even under stress conditions. Banks, however, were still seen as more exposed to interest rate risk than had been historically typical, albeit to a lesser degree than was the case earlier in the decade. In the nonbank sector, life insurers' allocation of assets toward private credit and risky assets, funded in part by nontraditional liabilities with short maturities, continued to grow. Leverage and rollover risk at hedge funds remained high and concentrated in the largest firms.

Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. Money market funds (MMFs) continued to be vulnerable to runs, though the aggregate assets of such prime and prime-like investment vehicles remained in the middle of their historical range as a fraction of GDP. Prime-like alternativesâincluding private liquidity funds, offshore MMFs, and stablecoinsâhave grown rapidly and were noted as relatively less transparent.

Staff Economic Outlook
The staff's real GDP growth projection for this year through 2027 was similar to the one prepared for the June meeting, reflecting the offsetting effects of several revisions to the outlook. The staff expected that the rise in the cost of imported goods inclusive of tariffs would be smaller and occur later than in their previous forecast; in addition, financial conditions were projected to be slightly more supportive of output growth. However, these positive influences on the outlook were offset by weaker-than-expected spending data and a smaller assumed population boost from net immigration. The staff continued to expect that the labor market would weaken, with the unemployment rate projected to move above the staff's estimate of its natural rate around the end of this year and to remain above the natural rate through 2027.

The staff's inflation projection was slightly lower than the one prepared for the June meeting, reflecting the downward revision to the assumed effects of tariffs on imported goods prices. Tariffs were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward pressure on inflation in 2026; inflation was then projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated, primarily reflecting uncertainty regarding changes to economic policies, including trade policy, and their associated economic effects. Risks to real activity were judged to remain skewed to the downside in light of the weakening in GDP growth seen so far this year and elevated policy uncertainty. The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of inflation, many participants observed that overall inflation remained somewhat above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that tariff effects were becoming more apparent in the data, as indicated by recent increases in goods price inflation, while services price inflation had continued to slow. A couple of participants suggested that tariff effects were masking the underlying trend of inflation and, setting aside the tariff effects, inflation was close to target.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants generally expected inflation to increase in the near term. Participants judged that considerable uncertainty remained about the timing, magnitude, and persistence of the effects of this year's increase in tariffs. In terms of timing, many participants noted that it could take some time for the full effects of higher tariffs to be felt in consumer goods and services prices. Participants cited several contributors to this likely lag. These included the stockpiling of inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs; slow pass-through of input cost increases into final goods and services prices; gradual updating of contract prices; maintenance of firmâcustomer relationships; issues related to tariff collection; and still-ongoing trade negotiations. As for the magnitude of tariff effects on prices, a few participants observed that evidence so far suggested that foreign exporters were paying at most a modest part of the increased tariffs, implying that domestic businesses and consumers were predominantly bearing the tariff costs. Several participants, drawing on information provided by business contacts or business surveys, expected that many companies would increasingly have to pass through tariff costs to end-customers over time. However, a few participants reported that business contacts and survey respondents described a mix of strategies as being undertaken to avoid fully passing on tariff costs to customers. Such strategies included negotiating with or switching suppliers, changing production processes, lowering profit margins, exerting more wage discipline, or exploiting cost-saving efficiency measures such as automation and new technologies. A few participants stressed that current demand conditions were limiting firms' ability to pass tariff costs into prices. Regarding inflation persistence, a few participants emphasized that they expected higher tariffs to lead only to a one-time increase in the price level that would be realized over a reasonably contained period. A few participants remarked that tariff-related factors, including supply chain disruptions, could lead to stubbornly elevated inflation and that it may be difficult to disentangle tariff-related price increases from changes in underlying trend inflation.

Participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important that they remain so. Several participants emphasized that inflation had exceeded 2 percent for an extended period and that this experience increased the risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored in the event of drawn-out effects of higher tariffs on inflation. A couple of participants noted that inflation expectations would likely be influenced by the behavior of the overall inflation rate, inclusive of the effects of tariffs. Various participants emphasized the central role of monetary policy in ensuring that tariff effects did not lead to persistently higher expected and realized inflation.

In their discussion of the labor market, participants observed that the unemployment rate remained low and that employment was at or near estimates of maximum employment. Several participants noted that the low and stable unemployment rate reflected a combination of low hiring and low layoffs. Some participants observed that their contacts and business survey respondents had reported being reluctant to hire or fire amid elevated uncertainty. Regarding the outlook for the labor market, some participants mentioned indicators that could suggest a softening in labor demand. These included slower and more concentrated job growth, an increase in cyclically sensitive Black and youth unemployment rates, and lower wage increases of job switchers than job stayers. Some of these participants also noted anecdotes in the Beige Book or in their discussions with contacts that pointed to slower demand. Furthermore, a number of participants noted that softness in aggregate demand and economic activity may translate into weaker labor market conditions, as could a potential inability of some importers to withstand higher tariffs. Some participants remarked, however, that slower output or employment growth was not necessarily indicative of emerging economic slack because a decline in immigration was lowering both actual and potential output growth as well as reducing both actual payroll growth and the number of new jobs needed to keep the unemployment rate stable. A few participants relayed reports received from contacts that immigration policies were affecting labor supply in some sectors, including construction and agriculture.

Participants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year, driven in large part by slower consumption growth and a decline in residential investment. Several participants stated that they expected growth in economic activity to remain low in the second half of this year. Some participants noted that economic activity would nevertheless be supported by financial conditions, including elevated household net worth, and a couple of participants highlighted stable or low credit card delinquencies. A couple of participants remarked that economic activity would be supported by the resolution of policy uncertainty over time. Regarding the household sector, several participants observed that slower real income growth may be weighing on growth in consumer spending. A few participants noted a weakening in housing demand, with increased availability of homes for sale and falling house prices. As for businesses, several participants remarked that ongoing policy uncertainty had continued to slow business investment, but several observed that business sentiment had improved in recent months. A few participants commented that the agricultural sector faced headwinds due to low crop prices.

In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated, though several participants remarked that there had been some reduction in uncertainty regarding fiscal policy, immigration policy, or tariff policy. Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate, emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment. A majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks, while several participants viewed the two risks as roughly balanced, and a couple of participants considered downside risk to employment the more salient risk. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants pointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. In addition to tariff-induced risks, potential downside risks to employment mentioned by participants included a possible tightening of financial conditions due to a rise in risk premiums, a more substantial deterioration in the housing market, and the risk that the increased use of AI in the workplace may lower employment.

In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Several participants noted concerns about elevated asset valuation pressures. Regarding banks, a couple of participants commented that, though regulatory capital levels remained strong, some banks continued to be vulnerable to a rise in longer-term yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets. A few participants commented on vulnerabilities in the market for Treasury securities, raising concerns about dealer intermediation capacity, the increasing presence of hedge funds in the market, and the fragility associated with low market depth. A couple of participants discussed foreign exchange swaps, noting that these served as key sources of dollar funding for foreign financial institutions that lend dollars to their customers in the U.S. and abroad, but also that they entailed vulnerabilities due to maturity mismatch and rollover risk. Many participants discussed recent and prospective developments related to payment stablecoins and possible implications for the financial system. These participants noted that use of payment stablecoins might grow following the recent passage of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act). They remarked that payment stablecoins could help improve the efficiency of the payment system. They also observed that such stablecoins could increase the demand for the assets needed to back them, including Treasury securities. In addition, participants who commented raised concerns that stablecoins could have broader implications for the banking and financial systems as well as monetary policy implementation, and thus warranted close attention, including monitoring of the various assets used to back stablecoins.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that the labor market was at or near maximum employment. Participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated. Almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent at this meeting. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that, with the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. Participants agreed that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Participants assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in the prices of some goods but that their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remained to be seen. They also noted that it would take time to have more clarity on the magnitude and persistence of higher tariffs' effects on inflation. Even so, some participants emphasized that a great deal could be learned in coming months from incoming data, helping to inform their assessment of the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate; at the same time, some noted that it would not be feasible or appropriate to wait for complete clarity on the tariffs' effects on inflation before adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Some participants stressed that the issue of the persistence of tariff effects on inflation would depend importantly on the stance of monetary policy. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level; among the considerations cited in support of this assessment was the likelihood that broader financial conditions were either neutral or supportive of stronger economic activity.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally agreed that the upside risk to inflation and the downside risk to employment remained elevated. Participants noted that, if this year's higher tariffs were to generate a larger-than-expected or a more-persistent-than-anticipated increase in inflation, or if medium- or longer-term inflation expectations were to increase notably, then it would be appropriate to maintain a more restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case, especially if labor market conditions remained solid. By contrast, if labor market conditions were to weaken materially or if inflation were to come down further and inflation expectations remained well anchored, then it would be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for the labor market weakened. Participants agreed that, if that situation were to occur, they would consider each variable's distance from the Committee's goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close. Participants noted that, in this context, it was especially important to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored.

Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Of those who commented, participants observed that balance sheet reduction had been proceeding smoothly thus far and that various indicators pointed to reserves being abundant. They agreed that, with reserves projected to decline amid the rebuilding of the TGA balance following the resolution of the debt limit situation, it was important to monitor money market conditions closely and to continue to evaluate how close reserves were to their ample level. A few participants also assessed that, in this environment, abrupt further declines in reserves could occur on key reporting and payment flow days. They noted that, if such events created pressures in money markets, the Federal Reserve's existing tools would help supply additional reserves and keep the effective federal funds rate within the target range. A couple of participants highlighted the role of the SRF in monetary policy implementationâas reflected in increased usage at the June quarter-endâand expressed support for further study of the possibility of central clearing of the SRF to enhance its effectiveness.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of the Committee's goals, almost all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. A couple of members preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. These members judged that, excluding tariff effects, inflation was running close to the Committee's 2 percent objective and that higher tariffs were unlikely to have persistent effects on inflation. Furthermore, they assessed that downside risk to employment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and consumer spending, and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions, including low levels of private payroll gains and the concentration of payroll gains in a narrow set of industries that were less affected by the business cycle. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:

""Effective July 31, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.""


The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:

""Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.""

Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Alberto G. Musalem, and Jeffrey R. Schmid.

Voting against this action: Michelle W. Bowman and Christopher J. Waller.

Absent and not voting: Adriana D. Kugler

Governors Bowman and Waller preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting. Governor Bowman preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 to 4-1/4 percent in light of inflation moving considerably closer to the Committee's objective, after excluding temporary effects of tariffs, a labor market near full employment but with signs of less dynamism, and slowing economic growth this year. She also expressed her view that taking action to begin moving the policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy and the risk of damage to the labor market.

Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective July 31, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayâWednesday, September 16â17, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m. on July 30, 2025.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations
The deputy manager turned first to an overview of financial market developments during the intermeeting period. Markets appeared to interpret data releases and FOMC communications as indicating that the baseline outlook was little changed but that downside risks to the labor market had increased. Median modal expectations for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation this year and next from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations (Desk survey) increased only slightly, and expectations for the unemployment rate increased only marginally overall. However, after the weaker-than-expected July and August employment reports, investors' focus shifted to downside risks to the labor market.

Near-term expectations for the policy rate had moved lower in response to weaker-than-expected employment data and the apparent rise in downside employment risks. Almost all respondents to the Desk survey expected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and around half expected an additional cut at the October meeting. The vast majority of survey respondents expected at least two 25 basis point cuts by year-end, with around half expecting three cuts over that time. Respondents' expectations for 2027 and beyond were unchanged, implying that revisions to respondents' near-term expectations reflected an anticipation of a faster return of the federal funds rate to its longer-run level than previously expected. Market-based measures of policy rate expectations were broadly consistent with responses to the Desk survey, reflecting about three 25 basis point cuts by the end of the year.

The deputy manager then discussed developments in Treasury markets and market-based measures of inflation compensation. Nominal Treasury yields fell 20 to 40 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the largest decline occurring at the short end of the yield curve; the curve therefore steepened. Staff models indicated that nearly all the decline in short-term rates was attributable to the shift down in policy rate expectations. Market-based measures of inflation compensation fell slightly over the intermeeting period.

Equity prices continued to rise over the intermeeting period and stood very close to record highs despite the recent weaker-than-expected employment reports. The deputy manager noted this development was consistent with the benign baseline macroeconomic outlook incorporated in most private-sector forecasts and strong realized earnings in technology and other sectors. Corporate bond spreads were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained at tight levels, signaling that investors anticipated relatively moderate credit losses.

Regarding foreign exchange developments, the deputy manager noted that the broad trade-weighted dollar index had generally stabilized and that the dollar returned to trading roughly in line with fundamental macroeconomic drivers over the intermeeting period. The available data continued to suggest foreign demand for U.S. assets remained resilient.

The deputy manager turned next to money markets. The effective federal funds rate remained stable, and repurchase agreement (repo) rates moved higher over the intermeeting period. The increase in repo rates over the period was driven by the increase in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding of the Treasury General Account (TGA) following the debt ceiling resolution, continued large Treasury coupon issuance, and ongoing reductions in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Reserves fell sharply on September 15 in response to an increase in the TGA, driven by tax receipts and significant net issuance of Treasury coupon securities. Repo rates came under additional upward pressure that day, and take-up at the standing repo facility (SRF) reached $1.5 billion. There were some signs of slight upward pressure on rates in the federal funds market but not enough to move the effective federal funds rate. While key indicators remained consistent with abundant reserves, money market rates were expected to continue to increase over time relative to administered rates and to eventually pull the effective federal funds rate higher.

The deputy manager concluded by discussing the trajectory of the balance sheet. If balance sheet runoff were to continue at the current pace, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio was expected to decline to just over $6 trillion by the end of March, with Federal Reserve notes growing at a gradual pace, the TGA fluctuating around current levels, and usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remaining very low except on quarter-end dates. As a result, the deputy manager expected reserves to be close to the $2.8 trillion range by the end of the first quarter of next year if runoff were to continue at the current pace.

All but one member of the Committee voted to ratify the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. Governor Stephen Miran, who had been sworn in as a member of the Board that morning, abstained from voting. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) growth had moderated in the first half of the year. Although the unemployment rate continued to be low, the pace of employment increases had slowed, and labor market conditions had softened. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.

Total consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price indexâwas estimated to have been 2.7 percent in August, based on the data from the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.9 percent in August. Both inflation rates were at the upper end of their ranges since the beginning of the year.

Recent data indicated that labor market conditions had softened. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August, a little higher than it had been at the beginning of the year. The participation rate was somewhat lower in August than it was at the beginning of the year. Average monthly increases in total nonfarm payrolls over July and August were weak, and job gains were revised down notably in May and June. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision for April 2024 through March 2025 indicated that the level of payrolls for March was more than 900,000 lower than had been reported. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.0 in August and remained within the narrow range seen over the past year. The employment cost index of hourly compensation for private-sector workers increased 3.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Both wage growth measures were lower than their year-earlier levels.

Real GDP rose in the second quarter after declining in the first quarter, but GDP growth over the first half as a whole was slower than last year. Growth of real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)âwhich comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentumâhad also moderated in the first half relative to last year. Recent indicators for consumer spending and business investment spendingâparticularly for high-tech equipment and softwareâpointed to further moderate gains in PDFP in the third quarter, but housing-sector activity remained weak. After falling sharply in the second quarter, real imports of goods increased in July, particularly for capital goods. By contrast, exports edged down in July, following modest increases over the first half of the year.

Foreign GDP growth slowed markedly in the second quarter, as the transitory boost due to the front-loading of U.S. imports earlier in the year faded. Canadian economic activity contracted significantly, as exports of price-sensitive industrial supplies fell sharply in the face of higher U.S. tariffs. Economic growth in Mexico and parts of Asia was supported by strong demand for high-tech products.

Headline inflation was near central banks' targets in most foreign economies, aided by past declines in energy prices. However, core inflation remained persistently elevated in some economies, such as Brazil, Mexico, and the U.K. By contrast, inflation in China continued to be subdued. Several foreign central banksâincluding the European Central Bankâheld their policy rates steady, while othersâsuch as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Reserve Bank of Australiaâresumed reducing their policy rates, as disinflation continued.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation
The market-implied path of the federal funds rate decreased notably over the intermeeting period. Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing a higher probability on greater policy easing by early 2026 than they had just before the July FOMC meeting. Consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path, nominal Treasury yields declined notably, on net, particularly at shorter horizons. Changes in nominal yields were driven primarily by reductions in real Treasury yields as inflation compensation fell to a lesser degree, on net, across maturities.

Broad equity price indexes increased amid strong corporate earnings reports and expectations of lower policy rates, while credit spreads were little changed and remained very low by historical standards. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 indexâthe VIXâended the period essentially unchanged, on net, at a moderate level.

Risk sentiment generally improved in global financial markets, supported by trade policy developments that were perceived as reducing negative tail risks to economic growth, strong corporate earnings, and lower interest rates in the U.S. On balance, foreign equity indexes rose moderately, credit spreads narrowed slightly, and the exchange value of the dollar declined modestly. Increased political uncertainty led to volatility of longer-term government bond yields in some advanced foreign economies.

Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period, and the FOMC's target policy rate continued to transmit to private rates in the usual manner. Following the increase in the federal debt limit in early July, TGA balances continued to increase, while usage of the ON RRP facility declined notably to its lowest levels since April 2021. Amid increases in the TGA, there were mild upward pressures in secured market rates over the July and August month-ends. Secured rates remained elevated in the lead-up to the mid-September tax and coupon issuance date. On September 15, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate temporarily printed above the minimum bid rate at the SRF amid $1.5 billion in take-up at the facility. Amid these movements in secured rates, the effective federal funds rate remained unchanged relative to the interest rate on reserve balances.

In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs generally declined but remained elevated relative to their average postâGlobal Financial Crisis (GFC) levels. Yields on corporate bonds decreased moderately, while yields on leveraged loans were little changed on net. Interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) and short-term business loans remained elevated relative to their post-GFC averages. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages declined moderately, on net, and remained elevated. Yields on higher-rated tranches of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) moved down modestly, and those on lower-rated tranches of non-agency CMBS declined notably. Interest rates on existing credit card accounts continued to tick up through June, while offer rates on new credit cards were little changed.

Financing from capital markets remained broadly available for medium-sized and large businesses. Gross issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds across credit categories continued at a strong pace in July and August, and issuance of leveraged loans was robust in recent months. Lending in private credit markets continued at a solid pace in July. After relatively strong growth in the second quarter, C&I loan balances on banks' books also continued to grow at a solid pace in July and August. Commercial real estate (CRE) loans continued to grow at a modest pace in July and August.

Credit remained available for most businesses, households, and municipalities, while credit continued to be relatively tight for small businesses and households with lower credit scores. In the residential mortgage market, credit remained easily available for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria but generally tight for low-credit-score borrowers. While consumer credit remained generally available for most households, the growth of revolving credit and auto loans was relatively weak in the second quarter.

Credit quality was generally stable at levels somewhat weaker than during the pre-pandemic period. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained generally stable, though the default rate for leveraged loans that includes distressed exchanges continued to be elevated. Delinquency rates on small business loans in June and July ticked up and were moderately above pre-pandemic levels. In the CRE market, CMBS delinquency rates remained elevated through August. Regarding household credit quality, the delinquency rates on Federal Housing Administration mortgages remained at the upper end of their range over the past few years. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types stayed near historical lows. In the second quarter, credit card and auto loan delinquency rates remained at elevated levels but were little changed.

Staff Economic Outlook
Compared with the staff forecast prepared for the July meeting, the projection of real GDP growth was revised up somewhat, on balance, for this year through 2028, primarily reflecting stronger-than-expected data for both consumer spending and business investment as well as financial conditions that were projected to be a little more supportive of output growth. GDP growth was still projected to be faster next year than this year, as the effects of tariff increases and slower net immigration were expected to diminish. The staff continued to expect that the labor market would soften further this year, though the projected path for the unemployment rate in following years was a little lower than in the previous staff forecast. The unemployment rate was projected to move slightly above the staff's estimate of its natural rate through the remainder of this year and then to decline later in the projection as GDP growth picked up.

The staff's inflation projection was only slightly revised from the one prepared for the July meeting. Tariff increases were still expected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward pressure on inflation in 2026. Inflation was projected to decline in 2026, to reach 2 percent in 2027, and to remain there in 2028.

The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated, primarily reflecting uncertainty regarding changes to economic policies, including those for trade, immigration, fiscal spending, and regulation, and their associated economic effects. Risks to employment and the labor market were judged to have become a little more tilted to the downside, stemming from the recent softening in labor market conditions amid modest real GDP growth. The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection.

Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 2028 and over the longer run. The projections were based on participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. Participants also provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated with their projections. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting.

Participants observed that inflation had moved up since the beginning of the year and remained somewhat above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Although participants generally assessed that this year's tariff increases had put upward pressure on inflation, some remarked that these effects appeared to have been somewhat muted to date relative to expectations from earlier in the year. A few participants suggested that productivity gains may be reducing inflation pressures. A couple of participants expressed the view that, excluding the effects of this year's tariff increases, inflation would be close to target. A few other participants, however, emphasized that progress of inflation toward the Committee's 2 percent objective had stalled, even excluding the effects of this year's tariff increases.

With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants generally expected that, given appropriate monetary policy, inflation would be somewhat elevated in the near term and would gradually return to 2 percent thereafter. Some participants noted that business contacts had indicated that they would raise prices over time because of higher input costs stemming from tariff increases. Uncertainty remained about the inflation effects of this year's increase in tariffs, though most participants expected these effects to be realized by the end of next year. Some participants remarked that the labor market was not expected to be a source of inflationary pressure. A couple of participants expected that the reduction in net migration would be associated with lower demand and lower inflation, and a couple of participants observed that continued productivity gains would likely reduce inflation pressures. Participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important they remain so to help return inflation to 2 percent. Various participants stressed the central role of monetary policy in ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. A majority of participants emphasized upside risks to their outlooks for inflation, pointing to inflation readings moving further from 2 percent, continued uncertainty about the effects of tariffs, the possibility that elevated inflation proves to be more persistent than currently expected even after the inflation effects of this year's tariff increases fade, or the possibility of longer-term inflation expectations moving up after a long period of elevated inflation readings. Some participants remarked that they perceived less upside risk to their outlooks for inflation than earlier in the year.

In their discussion of the labor market, participants observed that job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had edged up. Participants noted that the low level of estimated job gains over recent months likely reflected declines in growth of both labor supply and labor demand. Participants noted low net immigration or changes in labor force participation as factors reducing labor supply. As for factors that may be reducing labor demand, participants noted moderate economic growth or the effects of high uncertainty on firms' hiring decisions. Under these circumstances, participants cited a number of other indicators as helpful for assessing labor market conditions. These included the unemployment rate, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, wage growth, the percentage of unemployed workers who find a job, the quits rate among employed workers, and the layoff rate. Participants generally assessed that recent readings of these indicators did not show a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions. A few participants, though, saw recently released labor market data, including revisions to previously released data and the BLS's preliminary estimate of the payroll employment benchmark revision, as indicating that labor market conditions had been softening for longer than was previously reported.

With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, labor market conditions would be little changed or would soften modestly. Several participants noted that the number of monthly job gains consistent with a stable unemployment rate had declined over the past year and would likely remain low, citing the large number of workers nearing retirement age or continued low net immigration. Participants indicated that their outlooks for the labor market were uncertain and viewed downside risks to employment as having increased over the intermeeting period. In support of this view, participants mentioned a number of indicators, including the following: low hiring and firing rates, which are evidence of less dynamism in the labor market; concentrated job gains in a small number of sectors; and increases in unemployment rates for groups that have historically shown greater sensitivity to cyclical changes in economic activity, such as those for African Americans and young people. Several participants saw continuing adoption of artificial intelligence as potentially reducing labor demand. Some participants noted that survey responses indicated that household sentiment regarding the labor market had moved down.

Participants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year relative to last year. Regarding the household sector, participants noted that lower consumption growth had contributed to the slowdown in the growth of economic activity in the first half of the year. Several participants remarked that recent data indicated some firming of consumption expenditures this quarter. Some participants mentioned that households were showing greater price sensitivity, and several participants observed that high-income households were increasingly doing better, economically, than lower-income households. Several participants noted continued weakness in the housing market, and a couple of participants mentioned the possibility of a more substantial deterioration in the housing market as a downside risk to economic activity. For businesses, many participants noted strong high-tech investment. Several participants noted that financial conditions were supportive of economic activity. A few participants commented that the agricultural sector continued to face headwinds because of low crop prices and high input costs.

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had risen recently and remained somewhat elevated, and that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year. While participants noted the unemployment rate remained low, they observed that it had edged up and job gains had slowed. In addition, they judged that downside risks to employment had risen. Against this backdrop, almost all participants supported reducing the target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point at this meeting. Participants generally noted that their judgments about this meeting's appropriate policy action reflected a shift in the balance of risks. In particular, most participants observed that it was appropriate to move the target range for the federal funds rate toward a more neutral setting because they judged that downside risks to employment had increased over the intermeeting period and that upside risks to inflation had either diminished or not increased. A few participants stated there was merit in keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision. These participants noted that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective had stalled this year as inflation readings increased and expressed concern that longer-term inflation expectations may rise if inflation does not return to its objective in a timely manner. One participant agreed with the need to move policy toward a more neutral stance but preferred a 1/2 percentage point reduction at this meeting. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.

In considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants noted that, with the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. Participants observed that monetary policy was not on a preset course and would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Participants expressed a range of views about the degree to which the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and about the likely future path of policy. Most judged that it likely would be appropriate to ease policy further over the remainder of this year. Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally judged that upside risks to inflation remained elevated and that downside risks to employment were elevated and had increased. Participants noted that, in these circumstances, if policy were eased too much or too soon and inflation continued to be elevated, then longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored and make restoring price stability even more challenging. By contrast, if policy rates were kept too high for too long, then unemployment could rise unnecessarily, and the economy could slow sharply. Against this backdrop, participants stressed the importance of taking a balanced approach in promoting the Committee's employment and inflation goals, taking into account the extent of departures from those goals and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the Committee's mandate.

Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and implementation of monetary policy. A few participants stated that balance sheet reduction had proceeded smoothly thus far and that various indicators pointed to reserves remaining abundant. Nevertheless, with reserves declining and expected to decline further, they noted that it was important to continue to monitor money market conditions closely and evaluate how close reserves were to their ample level. In that context, a few participants noted that the SRF would help keep the federal funds rate within its target range and ensure that temporary pressures in money markets would not disrupt the ongoing reduction in Federal Reserve securities holdings to the level needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in the Committee's ample-reserves regime.

Committee Policy Actions
In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year. To reflect developments in the labor market, they agreed to no longer characterize labor market conditions as solid and instead state that job gains had slowed and that the unemployment rate had edged up but remained low. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated and agreed to add that inflation had moved up. They agreed that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and to add that downside risks to employment had risen to reflect their concerns about the labor market.

In support of the Committee's goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, almost all members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent. One member voted against that decision, preferring to lower the target range 1/2 percentage point at this meeting. Members agreed that, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:

""Effective September 18, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:


	Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent.
	Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.
	Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.
	Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.
	Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.
	Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.""


The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:


""Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.""


Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Alberto G. Musalem, Jeffrey R. Schmid, and Christopher J. Waller.

Voting against this action: Stephen I. Miran.

Governor Miran preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting in light of further softening in the labor market over the first half of the year and underlying inflation that in his view was meaningfully closer to 2 percent than was apparent in the data. Governor Miran also expressed the view that additional policy easing was also appropriate to reflect that the neutral rate of interest had fallen due to factors such as increased tariff revenues that had raised net national savings and changes in immigration policy that had reduced population growth.

Consistent with the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4 to 4-1/4 percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.15 percent, effective September 18, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 4.25 percent, effective September 18, 2025.2

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayâWednesday, October 28â29, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on September 17, 2025.
